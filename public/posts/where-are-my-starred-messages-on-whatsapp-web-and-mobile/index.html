Well, prepare to be amazed because we have uncovered the top-secret location of your starred WhatsApp messages.\nBefore we get into the details, let’s review what a starred message is. When you mark a message as starred in WhatsApp, it means you have highlighted that message as important and want to access it later. A star icon appears next to the message to indicate that it has been starred.\nBut where do these messages go? Many people think that starred messages are stored in a separate folder or chat, but that is not the case. In fact, starred messages are simply marked with a star and remain in their original chat.\nSo, how do you access all your starred messages in one place? The answer lies in your WhatsApp settings.\nFirst, open WhatsApp on your mobile device and click on the three dots in the top right corner to access the menu. Then, select “Settings” and click on “Starred Messages”. Voila! You will now see a list of all the messages you have starred across all your chats.\nBut that’s not all - you can also search for a specific starred message by typing in a keyword or phrase in the search bar. This makes it easy to find that important message you starred a few weeks ago.\nFurthermore, you can unstar messages from this list by simply clicking on the star icon next to the message. This removes the star and the message will no longer be listed under “Starred Messages”.\nIn conclusion, if you have been wondering where your starred messages go, we hope this article has revealed their top-secret location. By accessing your WhatsApp settings, you can access all your starred messages in one place and search for specific messages easily. So, go ahead and star away – you now know how to find and retrieve them whenever you need to.\nFind WhatsApp Starred Messages (iOS) There are two ways to find starred messages on WhatsApp on iOS.

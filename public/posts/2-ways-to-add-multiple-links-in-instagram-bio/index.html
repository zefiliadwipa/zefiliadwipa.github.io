With the limitation of only one clickable link in your bio, you need to make every click count. But what if we told you that you could expand your Instagram bio link capabilities?\nWith two techniques, you can optimize your bio link and extend its reach beyond the single website link provided by Instagram. In this article, we’ll discuss these techniques and how you can benefit from them.\nUsing Link Shorteners\nMost marketers suggest using your own domain to maximize your credibility and branding. However, if you want to add more links to your bio and don’t want to miss out on traffic and clicks, we suggest using a link shortener.\nLink shortening services like bit.ly and Rebrandly can help you create shortened URLs for each page you want to promote. You can then add these links to your bio, and your followers can click on them to visit the desired landing pages. This technique can help enhance your promotion strategies and drive more traffic to your favored sites.\nUsing Link Tree\nLinktree is a tool that allows you to add several clickable links to your Instagram bio. When your followers click on your Linktree link, they’ll be directed to a dashboard with all your clickable links that you’ve added.\nWith Linktree, you can include your YouTube channel, your product page, your blog, your social media accounts, and any other site you want your followers to engage with. This way, you can make do with the one clickable link provided by Instagram and still have access to several other links. Plus, it’s easy to use and only takes a minute to set up.\nConclusion\nYour Instagram bio link isn’t just an afterthought; it’s your chance to guide your followers toward your business, website, or blog. By using link shorteners and Linktree, you can enhance your promotion tactics, extend your reach, and take advantage of the limited one clickable link in your Instagram bio.\nTry out these two techniques today and see how they can help your brand grow on Instagram!\n1. Using Instagram Native Feature Earlier, Instagram allowed only one link in the bio. But that has changed. Now, you can add more than one link to your Instagram bio. Note: While some users are able to add multiple external links, at the time of writing, I could only add one external link and links to my Facebook account and group. Here are the steps to add multiple links to your Instagram bio:\nOpen the Instagram app on your Android or iPhone. Tap on the profile picture icon at the bottom to go to your profile screen. Tap on the Edit profile button. Tap on Links. Press the Add external link button. Add your website and give it a name. Tap on the Done button to confirm. If your account allows adding more external links, you will see the Add external link button again. Tap on it and add the second link. Alternatively, to add Facebook links, tap on Add Facebook link. You will be asked to set up the Accounts center. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the accounts center. Then, finally, you can add the link to your Facebook account and any group that you manage. This is how multiple links will look in your Instagram bio: Tip: Learn how to find link in bio on Instagram. 2. Using Third-Party Services If the above method doesn’t work for your Instagram account or you don’t like it, you can use free third-party services to add multiple links to your Instagram bio. These services give you one custom URL so that you can add it to your Instagram bio. Now here’s where things get interesting. The custom URL is basically an external page where you can add unlimited links. Picture this – you put one link in your Instagram bio and when a user opens the link, she/he will be greeted by a simple page with multiple links of your choice. Be assured that these services are easy to use and do not require any technical knowledge. The premium versions of these services even allow you to customize the layout of the landing page and password-protect links among other features. Let’s check the steps to add more than one link in the Instagram bio using the lnk.bio service. We have divided the steps into two sections:\nCreate Your Custom URL Follow these steps to create your custom external link for your Instagram bio:\nOpen lnk.bio in a browser on your mobile. Tap on the Sign up button and create an account with email or any of the services like FB business, Google, Twitter, etc. Enter a username for your account. It can be similar or different from your social media accounts. However, a good practice is to keep it the same as your accounts. Tap on the Continue button. Select the Free plan. You can even choose a premium plan. Tap on Lnk to add an external link to your landing page. Enter the website title and link in the available fields. Hit the Save button. Similarly, add more links. You can reorder the links using the Reorder button. Once you have added all the links, tap on the Copy button at the top to get your custom URL. You can paste it into a web browser to preview it.

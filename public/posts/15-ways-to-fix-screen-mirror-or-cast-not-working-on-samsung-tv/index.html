Well, fear not! In this article, we will share 15 simple tricks that will help you fix your TV troubles forever!\nStep 1: Check Your Network Connection The first thing you need to do is check your network connection. Make sure your TV is connected to the internet and try restarting your router or modem. Also, ensure that your Wi-Fi signal is strong enough to support screen mirroring or casting.\nStep 2: Update Your TV’s Software If your Samsung TV is outdated, it may cause issues when it comes to screen mirroring or casting. So, check for any available software updates for your TV and install them.\nStep 3: Use the Latest Version of the App Make sure you have the latest version of the app you’re trying to use for screen mirroring or casting. If not, update it to the latest version.\nStep 4: Disable Power Saving Mode Your TV might switch off its Wi-Fi connection to save power, causing connection issues. Disable the power-saving mode on your TV, and it should fix the problem.\nStep 5: Restart Your TV Sometimes all it takes is a simple restart to fix issues with screen mirroring or casting. Turn off your TV and unplug it from the power source for a few minutes, then plug it back in and turn it on again.\nStep 6: Enable Screen Mirroring or Casting Make sure screen mirroring or casting is enabled on your Samsung TV. From the TV’s menu, select “Screen Mirroring” or “Casting,” and turn it on.\nStep 7: Connect Your TV and Device to the Same Network For screen mirroring or casting to work, your TV and device need to be connected to the same network. Double-check that both are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.\nStep 8: Check Compatibility Not all devices are compatible with Samsung TVs for screen mirroring or casting. Check the manufacturer’s website to ensure that your device is compatible.\nStep 9: Reset Your Network Settings If you’re still facing issues, you can try resetting your network settings. Go to “Settings \u003e General \u003e Reset Network Settings” on your Samsung TV to restore it to its default settings.\nStep 10: Close Other Apps Running too many apps on your device can cause issues with screen mirroring or casting. Close all other running apps before attempting to mirror or cast.\nStep 11: Switch Wi-Fi Channels If your Wi-Fi signal is weak or congested, switching to a different Wi-Fi channel may help. Login to your router and change the Wi-Fi channel to a less crowded one.\nStep 12: Check Your Cables If you’re using cables to connect your device to your TV, check that they’re in good condition and correctly connected.\nStep 13: Factory Reset A factory reset is the last resort. This will restore your TV to its original settings and should fix any issues you’re facing. Follow the instructions on your TV for a factory reset.\nStep 14: Contact Customer Support If none of these solutions work, it’s time to seek help from the manufacturer’s customer support. They should be able to assist you in resolving the issue.\nStep 15: Consider Professional Help If all else fails, consider seeking professional help. A technician who specializes in TV repairs may be able to troubleshoot the issue and get your TV up and running again.\nIn conclusion, screen mirroring or casting issues on your Samsung TV can be frustrating but are often solvable with these simple tricks. Try them out the next time you face a problem, and you should be able to say goodbye to your TV troubles forever!\n1. Restart Devices Begin the troubleshooting process by restarting the concerned devices. That is, you must restart your TV, the phone from which you are trying to cast or mirror, and the Wi-Fi modem. To restart the TV and Wi-Fi modem, simply unplug it for 10 seconds and then plug it in again. To restart your phone, turn it off and on.\n2. Restart the TV Using the Remote A magical tip that seems to work wonderfully for any issue including the screen mirror or cast not working on Samsung smart TV is to restart it by pressing the Power button on your TV remote until the TV turns off and on.\n3. Check Streaming App Plan Some apps that are subscription-based do not allow watching content on TV on basic plans. So if you are trying to cast or mirror an app like Netflix or Disney+ with a basic plan from phone to TV, it will not work. Tip: Learn how to manage apps on Samsung TV.\n4. Use the Same Wi-Fi Network If your Samsung smart TV doesn’t show up in the list of devices when casting or screen mirroring from your Android or iPhone, there are chances that your TV and phone are connected to different Wi-Fi networks. Basically, your phone and Samsung TV must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network for cast or screen mirror to work. So, check the connected Wi-Fi network on your phone by going to Wi-Fi settings. To check Wi-Fi on Samsung TV, go to Settings \u003e General \u003e Network \u003e Open Network settings \u003e Wireless. The Wi-Fi your Samsung TV is using will have a blue tick next to it. Tip: If you’re facing any issues with Wi-Fi on Samsung TV, learn how to fix Wi-Fi not working on Samsung TV.\n5. Use 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi If your router supports both 2.4 and 5Ghz Wi-Fi networks, you must try to connect your Samsung TV and phone to a 2.4GHz network instead of 5Ghz. That’s because the hardware of some Samsung TVs isn’t compatible with a 5Ghz network. Learn how to change the Wi-Fi network on Samsung TV.\n6. Use the Right Technology The screen mirror and casting are two separate technologies. You should use the right one to connect your phone to the TV. The screen mirroring feature displays whatever is on your phone on the larger display, i.e., the Samsung TV. Please keep in mind that the screen mirror mirrors everything on your phone to your TV. That is, if you switch between apps, open the notification center, or do anything else, everything will appear on the bigger screen. On the other hand, the cast feature lets you show images and videos on the TV without actually mirroring your phone. That means you can minimize the app playing the video/photo and do other things on your phone while the video continues to play on the TV. A good way to preserve privacy. Now that you know the difference, you can go ahead and use the right technology to connect your phone to the TV.\n7. Re-enable AirPlay on TV Thankfully, Samsung smart TV supports both casting and mirroring from iPhone using AirPlay. But if iPhone won’t screen mirror or cast, there are chances that the AirPlay feature might be disabled on your TV. To enable AirPlay on Samsung TV, follow these steps:\nOpen Settings on your Samsung TV. Go to General \u003e Apple AirPlay settings. If AirPlay says Off, select it and it should turn on. Now, try to mirror or cast from your iPhone. In case AirPlay is already on in step 3, select it to turn it off. Restart your TV and then turn on the AirPlay again. 8. Use the Correct Steps to Cast or Screen Mirror To cast a video from your Android phone or iPhone, open a supported app like YouTube. Tap on the Cast icon at the top and select your Samsung TV. Select Allow on your TV or enter the code if asked. If you don’t see the Cast button in an app on your iPhone, then press the Share button and select AirPlay followed by selecting your Samsung TV. To screen mirror your iPhone to Samsung TV, open Control Center and tap on the Screen Mirror button. Select your Samsung TV. To mirror an Android phone to Samsung TV, open Quick Settings and tap on the Screen Mirror or Smart View tile. Tip: Check out other ways to connect your phone to Samsung TV.\n9. Grant Permission to Connect TV and Phone When you connect your Android phone or iPhone to a TV using the steps mentioned above, you will have to give permission to connect the two. The permission will either appear as a pop-up on your TV screen where you need to select Allow or you will have to enter a code on your phone which is displayed on your TV. Make sure to do that.\n10. Turn Bluetooth Off Many Samsung TV users suggest that turning off Bluetooth on their phone fixed the issue of cast or screen mirroring not working. You should try the same and disable Bluetooth.\n11. Update Software If screen mirroring or casting has stopped working on your Samsung TV after an update, there could be an issue with the update itself. Therefore, you must check and update your phone or TV again to the latest version. Hopefully, that should resolve the issue.\n12. Reset Paired Apple Devices If turning AirPlay off and on also didn’t help, you should re-pair your Samsung TV and iPhone, if iPhone isn’t casting or mirroring to Samsung TV. To do so, go to Settings \u003e General \u003e Apple AirPlay Settings \u003e Require code. Select Reset paired devices. A confirmation screen will show up. Select Remove. Then, re-connect iPhone to the TV as shown above.\n13. Enable Devices from TV There’s a slight chance that you might have accidentally denied permission to connect your phone and TV. To check and enable devices on TV, go to Settings \u003e General \u003e External device manager \u003e Device connection manager \u003e Device list. Select the device and choose Allow.\n14. Turn Auto Protection Time Off Your Samsung TV will show a screensaver if it’s inactive for two hours or more. Many users have suggested that this feature is also responsible for cast or screen mirroring not working on Samsung TVs. You should switch it off to see if it fixes the issue of the Samsung TV screen mirroring not working. To do so, go to Settings \u003e General \u003e System Manager. Select Auto protection time to turn it off.\n15. Try Another Smartphone Lastly, if nothing seems to fix the issue, you should try casting or mirroring from another phone to your TV. That way you can diagnose whether the issue is with the phone or TV.\nTips to Use Samsung TV After you have fixed the issue of the screen mirror or cast not working on your Samsung TV, check out the best tips to use Samsung smart TV.

Restart Devices<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-restart-devices>#</a></h2><p>Begin the troubleshooting process by restarting the concerned devices. That is, you must restart your TV, the phone from which you are trying to cast or mirror, and the Wi-Fi modem. To restart the TV and Wi-Fi modem, simply unplug it for 10 seconds and then plug it in again. To restart your phone, turn it off and on.</p><h2 id=2-restart-the-tv-using-the-remote>2. Restart the TV Using the Remote<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-restart-the-tv-using-the-remote>#</a></h2><p>A magical tip that seems to work wonderfully for any issue including the screen mirror or cast not working on Samsung smart TV is to restart it by pressing the Power button on your TV remote until the TV turns off and on.</p><h2 id=3-check-streaming-app-plan>3. Check Streaming App Plan<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-check-streaming-app-plan>#</a></h2><p>Some apps that are subscription-based do not allow watching content on TV on basic plans. So if you are trying to cast or mirror an app like Netflix or Disney+ with a basic plan from phone to TV, it will not work.
Tip: Learn how to manage apps on Samsung TV.</p><h2 id=4-use-the-same-wi-fi-network>4. Use the Same Wi-Fi Network<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#4-use-the-same-wi-fi-network>#</a></h2><p>If your Samsung smart TV doesn’t show up in the list of devices when casting or screen mirroring from your Android or iPhone, there are chances that your TV and phone are connected to different Wi-Fi networks. Basically, your phone and Samsung TV must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network for cast or screen mirror to work.
So, check the connected Wi-Fi network on your phone by going to Wi-Fi settings. To check Wi-Fi on Samsung TV, go to Settings > General > Network > Open Network settings > Wireless. The Wi-Fi your Samsung TV is using will have a blue tick next to it.
Tip: If you’re facing any issues with Wi-Fi on Samsung TV, learn how to fix Wi-Fi not working on Samsung TV.</p><h2 id=5-use-24ghz-wi-fi>5. Use 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#5-use-24ghz-wi-fi>#</a></h2><p>If your router supports both 2.4 and 5Ghz Wi-Fi networks, you must try to connect your Samsung TV and phone to a 2.4GHz network instead of 5Ghz. That’s because the hardware of some Samsung TVs isn’t compatible with a 5Ghz network. Learn how to change the Wi-Fi network on Samsung TV.</p><h2 id=6-use-the-right-technology>6. Use the Right Technology<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#6-use-the-right-technology>#</a></h2><p>The screen mirror and casting are two separate technologies. You should use the right one to connect your phone to the TV.
The screen mirroring feature displays whatever is on your phone on the larger display, i.e., the Samsung TV. Please keep in mind that the screen mirror mirrors everything on your phone to your TV. That is, if you switch between apps, open the notification center, or do anything else, everything will appear on the bigger screen.
On the other hand, the cast feature lets you show images and videos on the TV without actually mirroring your phone. That means you can minimize the app playing the video/photo and do other things on your phone while the video continues to play on the TV. A good way to preserve privacy.
Now that you know the difference, you can go ahead and use the right technology to connect your phone to the TV.</p><h2 id=7-re-enable-airplay-on-tv>7. Re-enable AirPlay on TV<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#7-re-enable-airplay-on-tv>#</a></h2><p>Thankfully, Samsung smart TV supports both casting and mirroring from iPhone using AirPlay. But if iPhone won’t screen mirror or cast, there are chances that the AirPlay feature might be disabled on your TV.
To enable AirPlay on Samsung TV, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Open Settings on your Samsung TV.</li><li>Go to General > Apple AirPlay settings.</li><li>If AirPlay says Off, select it and it should turn on. Now, try to mirror or cast from your iPhone.</li><li>In case AirPlay is already on in step 3, select it to turn it off. Restart your TV and then turn on the AirPlay again.</li></ol><h2 id=8-use-the-correct-steps-to-cast-or-screen-mirror>8. Use the Correct Steps to Cast or Screen Mirror<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#8-use-the-correct-steps-to-cast-or-screen-mirror>#</a></h2><p>To cast a video from your Android phone or iPhone, open a supported app like YouTube. Tap on the Cast icon at the top and select your Samsung TV. Select Allow on your TV or enter the code if asked.
If you don’t see the Cast button in an app on your iPhone, then press the Share button and select AirPlay followed by selecting your Samsung TV.
To screen mirror your iPhone to Samsung TV, open Control Center and tap on the Screen Mirror button. Select your Samsung TV.
To mirror an Android phone to Samsung TV, open Quick Settings and tap on the Screen Mirror or Smart View tile.
Tip: Check out other ways to connect your phone to Samsung TV.</p><h2 id=9-grant-permission-to-connect-tv-and-phone>9. Grant Permission to Connect TV and Phone<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#9-grant-permission-to-connect-tv-and-phone>#</a></h2><p>When you connect your Android phone or iPhone to a TV using the steps mentioned above, you will have to give permission to connect the two. The permission will either appear as a pop-up on your TV screen where you need to select Allow or you will have to enter a code on your phone which is displayed on your TV. Make sure to do that.</p><h2 id=10-turn-bluetooth-off>10. Turn Bluetooth Off<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#10-turn-bluetooth-off>#</a></h2><p>Many Samsung TV users suggest that turning off Bluetooth on their phone fixed the issue of cast or screen mirroring not working. You should try the same and disable Bluetooth.</p><h2 id=11-update-software>11. Update Software<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#11-update-software>#</a></h2><p>If screen mirroring or casting has stopped working on your Samsung TV after an update, there could be an issue with the update itself. Therefore, you must check and update your phone or TV again to the latest version. Hopefully, that should resolve the issue.</p><h2 id=12-reset-paired-apple-devices>12. Reset Paired Apple Devices<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#12-reset-paired-apple-devices>#</a></h2><p>If turning AirPlay off and on also didn’t help, you should re-pair your Samsung TV and iPhone, if iPhone isn’t casting or mirroring to Samsung TV.
To do so, go to Settings > General > Apple AirPlay Settings > Require code.
Select Reset paired devices. A confirmation screen will show up. Select Remove. Then, re-connect iPhone to the TV as shown above.</p><h2 id=13-enable-devices-from-tv>13. Enable Devices from TV<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#13-enable-devices-from-tv>#</a></h2><p>There’s a slight chance that you might have accidentally denied permission to connect your phone and TV.
To check and enable devices on TV, go to Settings > General > External device manager > Device connection manager > Device list. Select the device and choose Allow.</p><h2 id=14-turn-auto-protection-time-off>14. Turn Auto Protection Time Off<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#14-turn-auto-protection-time-off>#</a></h2><p>Your Samsung TV will show a screensaver if it’s inactive for two hours or more. Many users have suggested that this feature is also responsible for cast or screen mirroring not working on Samsung TVs.
You should switch it off to see if it fixes the issue of the Samsung TV screen mirroring not working. To do so, go to Settings > General > System Manager. Select Auto protection time to turn it off.</p><h2 id=15-try-another-smartphone>15. Try Another Smartphone<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#15-try-another-smartphone>#</a></h2><p>Lastly, if nothing seems to fix the issue, you should try casting or mirroring from another phone to your TV. That way you can diagnose whether the issue is with the phone or TV.</p><h2 id=tips-to-use-samsung-tv>Tips to Use Samsung TV<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tips-to-use-samsung-tv>#</a></h2><p>After you have fixed the issue of the screen mirror or cast not working on your Samsung TV, check out the best tips to use Samsung smart TV.

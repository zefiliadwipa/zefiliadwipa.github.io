In this article, we’ll share 15 vital tips you need to know right now to unlock the secrets of the Twitter circle.\nKnow Your Audience Twitter is all about building your audience and engaging with them. To do this effectively, you need to know who your audience is and what motivates them. Use Twitter analytics to identify your most engaged followers, and tailor your content to their interests and preferences.\nUse Hashtags Strategically Hashtags are a powerful way to reach a broader audience and increase engagement. Research popular hashtags in your industry and use them strategically in your tweets. Don’t overuse hashtags, as this can make your tweets appear spammy.\nLeverage Twitter Lists Twitter Lists allow you to group users by topic or interest, making it easier to track conversations and engage with specific audiences. Create lists of influencers, industry experts, or even competitors to stay informed on the latest news and trends.\nUse Twitter Moments Twitter Moments allows you to curate tweets around a specific topic, making it easier for your audience to follow along with a trending conversation. Use Twitter Moments to share news and updates about your business, or to highlight industry news and insights.\nCreate Engaging Content Twitter is a fast-paced platform that demands attention-grabbing content. Use eye-catching visuals or headlines to stand out in the crowded Twitter feed. Use Twitter polls or ask questions to engage your audience and encourage interaction.\nUse Twitter Video Twitter video allows you to create engaging visual content that stands out in the Twitter feed. Use video to share behind-the-scenes insights, product demos, or customer testimonials.\nMonitor Your Mentions Monitoring your Twitter mentions is crucial to building engagement and responding to customer inquiries. Use Twitter’s native notification feature or third-party tools to track mentions of your brand or business.\nEngage with Influencers Influencers can help amplify your message and increase your reach on Twitter. Engage with influencers in your industry by commenting and retweeting their content, or by reaching out to them for collaborations or partnerships.\nUse Twitter Chats Twitter chats allow you to engage with a passionate audience around a specific topic or theme. Join in on Twitter chats in your industry or create your own to build engagement and awareness around your brand.\nUse Twitter Ads Twitter ads can help increase your reach and drive traffic to your website or landing page. Use Twitter ads to target specific audiences based on interests or demographics, or to promote your latest content or product.\nUnderstand Twitter Etiquette Following Twitter etiquette is crucial to maintaining a positive and engaged audience. Avoid overselling or spamming your followers, engage with your audience in a respectful and authentic manner, and use appropriate language and tone in your tweets.\nAnalyze Your Twitter Data Analyzing your Twitter data can help you understand which types of content are resonating with your audience, and where you need to make improvements. Use Twitter analytics to track engagement, clicks, and other key metrics.\nKeep Up with Twitter Trends Twitter is a fast-paced platform that is constantly evolving. Keep up with the latest Twitter trends and features, and adapt your Twitter strategy accordingly to stay ahead of the curve.\nUse Twitter for Customer Service Twitter can be a powerful tool for customer service and support. Use Twitter to respond to customer inquiries, offer support or troubleshooting, or even to handle customer complaints.\nNetwork with Other Twitter Users Networking with other Twitter users and businesses can help build your audience and increase your reach on the platform. Attend Twitter events or meetups, engage with your followers and other industry influencers, and build relationships with other businesses in your industry.\nUnlocking the secrets of the Twitter circle requires patience, effort, and a deep understanding of the platform’s many features and tools. By following these 15 vital tips, you can build a powerful Twitter presence that engages your followers, promotes your brand, and drives real results for your business.\n1. What Is a Twitter Circle Earlier, if you tweeted something, everyone who followed you could see the tweet. You could restrict the replies but visibility was still an issue. This is where Circle helps. Twitter Circle is a feature that lets you share your thoughts with a select few people only. The tweet will only be visible to the people in your Circle. Nobody else can see it. Moreover, only the people in the Circle can interact with the tweet. It’s like a mini-protected Twitter within the main Twitter. If you know about Instagram’s Close Friends feature, Twitter Circle is somewhat similar to that.\n2. How Do You Get Twitter Circle You will automatically receive the Twitter Circle feature on your account. Just open the tweet composer screen and you will be greeted by a pop-up window that introduces the Twitter Circle feature. If you don’t see it, make sure to update the Twitter app or reopen the browser if you are using the Twitter website.\n3. Who Can Create a Twitter Circle Anyone with a Twitter profile can create a Twitter Circle on both mobile and computer.\n4. How to Use Twitter Circle Let’s check how to create, see, or edit Twitter Circle.\nHow to Create Twitter Circle on Mobile Open the Twitter app on your Android or iPhone. Tap on your profile picture in the top-left corner of Twitter’s home screen. Choose Twitter Circle from the menu. You will reach the Edit your Twitter circle screen. If it’s your first time using Twitter Circle, you will be suggested people that you can add to the Circle. Tap on the Recommended tab at the top. Then, search for the people whom you want to add to the Circle. Hit the Add button next to them. Pro Tip: You can also create Twitter Circle from the tweet compose screen. Tap on the floating (+) Add button at the bottom. Choose Tweet from the menu. Tap on Public/Everyone at the top and press the Edit button next to Twitter Circle. Then, add people to Circle. How to Create Twitter Circle on PC Open the Twitter website and click on the More button in the left sidebar. Choose Twitter Circle from the menu. Click on the Recommended tab. Find the people whom you want to add. Click on the Add button next to their name. How to Send Tweets to Twitter Circle on Mobile Open the Twitter app on your Android phone or iPhone. Tap on the floating (+) Add button at the bottom. Choose Tweet from the menu. Tap on Public or Everyone at the top and select Twitter Circle. Now, type the tweet and hit the Tweet button to publish it to the Circle. How to Send Tweets to Twitter Circle on PC Click on the What’s happening box or the tweet compose box on the main screen of Twitter. Click on the Everyone drop-down box and select Twitter Circle. Type the tweet and publish it using the Tweet button. How to See and Edit Twitter Circle on Mobile You can edit your Twitter Circle list anytime.\nIn the Twitter app, tap on your profile picture in the top-left corner. Select Twitter Circle. Here you will see the people added to the Twitter Circle list. Tap the Remove button next to the person you want to remove from your Twitter Circle. How to View and Edit Twitter Circle on PC On the Twitter website, click on the More button in the sidebar. Select Twitter Circle. You will see the people added to the Twitter Circle. Click on the Remove button next to the person if you want to remove them from the Circle. You can also view and edit your Twitter Circle from the tweet compose box. Click on the audience selector box that either says Everyone or Twitter Circle. Then, click the Edit button next to Twitter Circle. You will be taken to the screen shown in step 3 where you can view and remove people from your Circle. 5. Whom Can You Add to Twitter Circle You can add anyone to your Twitter Circle. Be it your closest friend, an acquaintance, or a celebrity. It doesn’t matter whether the person follows you or not. If their account is searchable, you can add them to your Circle.\n6. Are People Notified When You Add or Remove Them From Your Circle Twitter will not notify the users when you add or remove them from your Circle.\n7. How Many People Can Be Added to Circle You can have only one Twitter Circle per profile where you can add up to 150 people.\n8. Who Can Interact With Tweets in Your Circle Only the people added to your Circle can see the tweets and interact with them. By interaction, we mean like the tweet and reply to a tweet. The tweets published to the Circle audience cannot be retweeted. Furthermore, if someone replies to your tweet, any other user who is also added to your Circle can see that reply.\n9. Who Can See the People In Your Twitter Circle The Twitter Circle list is private. Only the creator of the Circle can see the people added to it.\n10. What Happens to Screenshots in Twitter Circle People added to your circle can take a screenshot of your tweets. Twitter won’t notify you about the screenshots.\n11. What Happens to Previous Tweets When you add someone to your Twitter Circle, they will be able to see your previous Twitter Circle Tweets.\n12. How to Identify Tweets Published for a Circle When you tweet something just for your Twitter Circle, a green badge will appear under your tweet that says “Only people in @XYZ’s Twitter Circle can see this tweet”. Both the publisher and the people included in the Circle will see this badge. That’s how a person will know that the tweet is published just for the Circle audience. Tip: Learn how to change the Twitter source label.\n13. How to Leave a Twitter Circle If you have been added to a Circle that you do not want to be a part of, you cannot leave the Circle directly. You will either have to mute, unfollow, or block the creator of the Circle.\n14. How to Send Tweets to Everyone Instead of Circle If you want to tweet to everyone instead of just to your Circle, simply open the tweet compose box. Then, click or tap on the audience selector box that says Twitter Circle. Choose Everyone.\n15. What’s the Difference Between Twitter Circle and Protected Tweets You can protect all of your tweets by switching to a private account. That way only your followers can see and interact with your tweets. On the other hand, Twitter Circle lets you share some of your tweets with a limited number of people. So, while a private account protects all your tweets, Twitter Circle protects selected tweets only. Use Twitter Like a Pro That’s all about Twitter Circle. If you have been using Twitter for a while and the various icons still confuse you, find out the meaning of icons and symbols on Twitter. Also, learn how to have a blank name on Twitter.\n","wordCount":"1937","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Elsie Thompson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/posts/15-important-things-to-know-about-twitter-circle-/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zefiliadwipa","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock Twitter Circle Secrets: 15 Vital Tips You Need to Know Right Now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 28, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1937 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Elsie Thompson</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-what-is-a-twitter-circle>1.

Whom Can You Add to Twitter Circle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#5-whom-can-you-add-to-twitter-circle>#</a></h2><p>You can add anyone to your Twitter Circle. Be it your closest friend, an acquaintance, or a celebrity. It doesn’t matter whether the person follows you or not. If their account is searchable, you can add them to your Circle.</p><h2 id=6-are-people-notified-when-you-add-or-remove-them-from-your-circle>6. Are People Notified When You Add or Remove Them From Your Circle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#6-are-people-notified-when-you-add-or-remove-them-from-your-circle>#</a></h2><p>Twitter will not notify the users when you add or remove them from your Circle.</p><h2 id=7-how-many-people-can-be-added-to-circle>7. How Many People Can Be Added to Circle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#7-how-many-people-can-be-added-to-circle>#</a></h2><p>You can have only one Twitter Circle per profile where you can add up to 150 people.</p><h2 id=8-who-can-interact-with-tweets-in-your-circle>8. Who Can Interact With Tweets in Your Circle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#8-who-can-interact-with-tweets-in-your-circle>#</a></h2><p>Only the people added to your Circle can see the tweets and interact with them. By interaction, we mean like the tweet and reply to a tweet. The tweets published to the Circle audience cannot be retweeted. Furthermore, if someone replies to your tweet, any other user who is also added to your Circle can see that reply.</p><h2 id=9-who-can-see-the-people-in-your-twitter-circle>9. Who Can See the People In Your Twitter Circle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#9-who-can-see-the-people-in-your-twitter-circle>#</a></h2><p>The Twitter Circle list is private. Only the creator of the Circle can see the people added to it.</p><h2 id=10-what-happens-to-screenshots-in-twitter-circle>10. What Happens to Screenshots in Twitter Circle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#10-what-happens-to-screenshots-in-twitter-circle>#</a></h2><p>People added to your circle can take a screenshot of your tweets. Twitter won’t notify you about the screenshots.</p><h2 id=11-what-happens-to-previous-tweets>11. What Happens to Previous Tweets<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#11-what-happens-to-previous-tweets>#</a></h2><p>When you add someone to your Twitter Circle, they will be able to see your previous Twitter Circle Tweets.</p><h2 id=12-how-to-identify-tweets-published-for-a-circle>12. How to Identify Tweets Published for a Circle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#12-how-to-identify-tweets-published-for-a-circle>#</a></h2><p>When you tweet something just for your Twitter Circle, a green badge will appear under your tweet that says “Only people in @XYZ’s Twitter Circle can see this tweet”. Both the publisher and the people included in the Circle will see this badge. That’s how a person will know that the tweet is published just for the Circle audience.
Tip: Learn how to change the Twitter source label.</p><h2 id=13-how-to-leave-a-twitter-circle>13. How to Leave a Twitter Circle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#13-how-to-leave-a-twitter-circle>#</a></h2><p>If you have been added to a Circle that you do not want to be a part of, you cannot leave the Circle directly. You will either have to mute, unfollow, or block the creator of the Circle.</p><h2 id=14-how-to-send-tweets-to-everyone-instead-of-circle>14. How to Send Tweets to Everyone Instead of Circle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#14-how-to-send-tweets-to-everyone-instead-of-circle>#</a></h2><p>If you want to tweet to everyone instead of just to your Circle, simply open the tweet compose box. Then, click or tap on the audience selector box that says Twitter Circle. Choose Everyone.</p><h2 id=15-whats-the-difference-between-twitter-circle-and-protected-tweets>15. What’s the Difference Between Twitter Circle and Protected Tweets<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#15-whats-the-difference-between-twitter-circle-and-protected-tweets>#</a></h2><p>You can protect all of your tweets by switching to a private account. That way only your followers can see and interact with your tweets. On the other hand, Twitter Circle lets you share some of your tweets with a limited number of people. So, while a private account protects all your tweets, Twitter Circle protects selected tweets only.  </p><h2 id=use-twitter-like-a-pro>Use Twitter Like a Pro<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#use-twitter-like-a-pro>#</a></h2><p>That’s all about Twitter Circle.

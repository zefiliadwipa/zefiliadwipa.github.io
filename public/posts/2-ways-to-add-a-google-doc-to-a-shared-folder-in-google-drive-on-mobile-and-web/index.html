By following the two simple tricks outlined above, you can share your documents with ease, whether you’re using your mobile device or the web. These tricks can save you time and help you collaborate with others more efficiently. So, next time you need to share a Google Doc, remember to create a shareable link or share via email – you’ll be amazed at how straightforward it is!\nNote: Please make sure you’ve Google Drive and Google Docs installed on your iOS and Android devices so that you can seamlessly follow the steps below.\nWhat Is a Shared Folder A Shared Folder is just a folder inside a Google Drive that has been shared with one or more users. Shared Folder gives multiple people access to the same folder so they can easily edit and collaborate on files saved inside it. You can easily convert a regular folder to a Shared Folder by following these steps.\nIf you’re on the Web, open Google Drive in your browser, navigate to the folder you want to share \u003e Right click \u003e Get link \u003e Restricted (under General access) \u003e Anyone with the link \u003e Done. Pro Tip: After turning a normal folder into a shared one, tap on Copy link from the same pop-up menu to copy its link in the clipboard and then tap on Done to finish. If you’re on iOS or Android, first open the Google Drive app. Navigate to the folder you want to share \u003e kebab menu next to the folder \u003e Manage access \u003e Restricted (under General access) \u003e Restricted \u003e Anyone with the link. Note: There are two types of Shared Folder in Google Drive. The first one that you’ll be creating will appear under the Files tab on mobile devices and in My Drive on the web. The second one, that’s being shared with you. You can find such folders in the Shared tab on mobile devices and Shared with me on the web. Add Google Doc to a Shared Folder on the Web If you’re wondering how to add a Google Doc to a Shared folder on the web, then let me help you with that too. Here are the two ways to add a Google Doc to a Shared folder in Google Drive. Let’s begin.\n1. Creating a Google Doc Inside a Shared Folder The first way to add a Google Doc to a Shared folder on the web is to create it inside the Shared folder. Let’s take a look at the steps to do so.\nOpen drive.google.com in your choice of browser and log in to your Google account (we’re currently using Safari to demonstrate the process). Click on the Shared with me tab on the left side of the web page. Double-click on the Shared folder to open it. Now click on + New button in the left sidebar. A drop-down menu will open in front of you. Click on the Google Docs option to begin. A pop-up menu will appear in the middle of the screen. Tap on CREATE AND SHARE. A new tab will open with an untitled Google Doc. Once done with the editing, click on the Untitled document to rename it. Type a name for the Google Doc. Now close the tab by clicking on the little X mark. As you close this tab, the newly created Google Doc will appear in the Shared Folder. 2. Moving a Google Doc to a Shared Folder Apart from the previous way, there’s one more way to add a Google Doc to a Shared folder in Google Drive on the web. This method includes moving a previously saved Google Doc to the Shared folder. Let’s take a look at the steps of how to do so.\nOpen drive.google.com in your choice of browser and log in to your Google account (we’re currently using Safari to demonstrate the process). Navigate to the Google Doc that you want to move to the Shared folder and right-click on it. A drop-down menu with a list of options will open. Click on Move to. A tiny window will open just beneath the Google Doc. Click on the back arrow to navigate to the Shared folder. Note: Depending upon the location of the Google Doc, you might need to click on the back arrow a few times to reach the root directory. Once you’ve reached the root directory of your Google Drive, double-click on Shared with me. Now scroll to the Shared folder and double-click on it to open it. Click on MOVE HERE to move the Google Doc. Click on MOVE to confirm. Add Google Doc to a Shared Folder on iOS There are two ways to add a Google Doc to a Shared Folder in Google Drive on iOS devices. Let’s have a look at both ways below.\n1. Creating a Google Doc Inside a Shared Folder (iOS) Open the Google Drive app on your iPhone and tap on the Shared tab. Tap on the Shared folder to open it, in which you want to add a Google Doc. Tap on the + icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. Tap on Google Docs to begin. Type a name for the new document and then tap on Create. Once you’re done editing the Google Doc, tap on the blue tick to save it. Once the Google Doc is saved, tap on the \u003c Drive button just below the time to go back to the Shared folder in your Google Drive. And the Google Doc will appear in the Shared folder now. 2. Moving a Google Doc to a Shared Folder (iOS) You might have a previously saved Google Doc in your Google Drive which you might want to move to a Shared folder. In that case, let’s take a look at the steps of how to move a Google Doc to a Shared folder on iOS devices.\nOpen the Google Drive app on your smartphone and locate the Google Doc in it. Tap on the kebab menu (three dots). Tap on Move. Tap on Shared with me. Tap on the Shared folder (for us it is Team Projects). Tap on Move here in the bottom right corner of the screen. A pop-up menu will appear, tap on Move to confirm the moving of Google Doc into the Shared folder. Add Google Doc to a Shared Folder on Android Just like iOS, Android users can also add a Google Doc to a Shared Folder in Google Drive. There are two ways to do this. Let’s have a look at both ways to do so.\n1. Creating a Google Doc Inside a Shared Folder Open Google Drive on your Android smartphone and tap on the Shared tab. Tap on the Shared folder to which you want to add a Google Doc. Tap on the + button in the bottom right corner of the screen to begin. Tap on Google Docs from the available list of options. A new Google Doc will open in front of you. Once done editing inside the Google Doc, tap on the tick to save it. Tap on the Untitled document to rename the Google Doc. Type a desired name for the Google Doc and then tap on OK. Tap on the X to close the Google Doc and return to the Shared folder. You’ll be able to view the Google Doc in the Shared folder now. 2. Moving a Google Doc to a Shared Folder If you have got a previously saved Google Doc in your Google Drive, you might want to move that to a Shared folder. In that case, let’s take a look at the steps below.\nNavigate the Google Doc into Google Drive, and tap on the kebab menu right next to it. Tap on the Move option to begin. Tap on the back arrow to navigate to the destination (in our case, I had to press the back arrow twice, for you it may be more or less). Now tap on Shared with me. Tap on the Shared folder to open it. Tap on Move. A pop-up menu will now appear on the screen, tap on Move again. And the Google Doc will now appear in the Shared folder. Do More with Google Drive Google Drive is an excellent tool for collaborating with others online. Now you can easily add a Google Doc to a Shared folder in Google Drive, whenever you need to share it with someone. Just follow the above-mentioned steps, and you’ll be able to add a Google Doc in no time whether you’re on iOS, Android, or the web. There’s one more Google tool for communicating while collaborating with others named Google Chat. Do you know how to change status in Google Chat on web and mobile?

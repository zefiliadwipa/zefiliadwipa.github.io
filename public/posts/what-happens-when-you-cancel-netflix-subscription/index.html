Canceling your Netflix subscription can have a significant impact on your life. In this article, we will uncover the reasons why you should not cancel your Netflix subscription.\nBinge-watch Your Favorite Shows If you love binge-watching your favorite shows, then canceling your Netflix subscription is a mistake you will regret. Netflix offers an extensive library of TV shows and movies that you cannot find anywhere else. The streaming giant has become synonymous with binge-watching culture, and for all the right reasons.\nDiscover New Shows One of the best things about Netflix is discovering new shows that you would have never heard of otherwise. With its algorithm, Netflix recommends shows based on your viewing history, saving you the time and effort of searching for something new to watch.\nNo More Movie Nights Netflix is perfect for cozy movie nights with friends and family. Whether you want to watch the latest releases or your favorite classics, Netflix has got you covered. Canceling your subscription would mean bidding farewell to these fun movie nights.\nNo More Relaxing Weekends Weekends are meant for relaxing, and Netflix is an essential part of that relaxation process. With its vast library of shows and movies, you can spend a whole weekend binge-watching your favorite shows. Imagine a weekend without Netflix - how boring would that be?\nMiss out on Latest Releases Netflix is known for releasing some of the most popular TV shows and movies. Missing out on these releases would be a shame, especially if you are a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) or Stranger Things.\nNo More Netflix and Chill Last but not least, canceling your Netflix subscription would mean saying goodbye to the ultimate date night - Netflix and chill. Nothing beats spending a cozy evening with your significant other, snuggled up on the couch, binge-watching your favorite shows.\nIn conclusion, canceling your Netflix subscription might seem like a good idea at first, but it’s not worth it. You will miss out on your favorite shows, cozy movie nights, and relaxing weekends. So, if you are thinking of canceling your Netflix subscription, think twice before you do so. Your world might never be the same again!\nLet’s begin.\nHow to Cancel Netflix Subscription From Browser First, let’s take a quick look at how to cancel your Netflix subscription.\nLog in to your Netflix account if you haven’t already. Do so in a browser on your computer. Now open the Netflix Cancelation page and click on Finish Cancelation button. Other options include Go Back which means changing your mind about canceling Netflix subscription and Downgrade Your Plan which means choosing a less expensive plan. Your Netflix membership should be canceled now. Note that there is no confirmation dialogue that will appear and plan will be canceled immediately. How to Cancel Netflix Subscription From iTunes If you have subscribed to Netflix using iTunes on your iPhone or iPad, then you will need to unsubscribe to Netflix from iTunes too.\nOpen Settings \u003e Your Name \u003e Subscriptions. You should see a list of all active subscriptions. Select Netflix here and tap on Cancel Subscription. Finally, tap on Confirm if you see a pop-up. You can resubscribe to Netflix anytime you like but in the interim, here are some things you need to know. What Happens When You Cancel Netflix Subscription Netflix, like all online sites, monitors your habits and collects data to cater to your needs better. They don’t and won’t let you go in a hurry after all. Here are some interesting facts.\nCan You Cancel Netflix Subscription on the Mobile Apps You can unsubscribe from Netflix only from the web app which means by using a browser. In the case of the iPhone, you can unsubscribe using iTunes but Android doesn’t offer a unified subscription layer.\nHow Long Can You Watch Netflix After Canceling Subscription Netflix charges your credit card in advance which means you still have a few days before your account is closed for good. If your billing date is the 14th, then you can continue watching Netflix until the 13th of the next month, that is until the billing period ends.\nWhat About My Netflix Profiles, Favorites, and Preferences Netflix will maintain your profiles, favorites, viewing preferences, and account details for up to 10 months. After that, all will be deleted from their servers. That’s a good amount of time to rethink whether you want to join Netflix again.\nWhat Other Data Netflix Stores for 10 Months After Cancelation Quite a lot, actually. Netflix will preserve the following data in the hopes that you will return to them one day.\nRatingsYour recommendationsAccount detailsGame saves (unless game/game data aren’t deleted from device)Gameplay history\nWhat Does Pausing Netflix Membership Means and How It Works Netflix released a new feature called Pause Membership. It works exactly the same way as canceling a membership does. You follow the same steps as above. It’s just that instead of deleting your data immediately, Netflix will wait for 10 months now. Hence the name.\nCan I Have My Data Deleted Before the 10 Month Period Ends Yes, but that will require an additional step. You have to mail Netflix at privacy@netflix.com from the same email ID that you used to register your Netflix account. We recommend using ‘Request for account deletion’ as the subject heading. Ask them to delete all data associated with your profile. You should receive a confirmation email in a few days.\nCan I Cancel My Netflix Plan Anytime Yes. You can cancel your subscription to Netflix at any time on any given day. The service works 24x7x365 after all.\nWhat If I Don’t See Cancelation Option in My Netflix Account It is possible that you subscribed to Netflix through a third party. We already saw iTunes’ example. Maybe your company, where you work, subscribed to Netflix on your behalf. Contact your senior or your billing company to check if they can cancel your Netflix subscription on your behalf.\nCan I Rejoin Netflix and If Yes, How Yes, you can easily begin your subscription again. All you have to do is open Your Account page in a browser and click on the Restart Membership button. Your Netflix membership will begin within seconds. You will see a confirmation message.\nDo I Need to Update My Netflix Payment Details No, you don’t have to update payment details since Netflix already has it and maintains the same for up to 10 months. However, if you want to, yes, you can change your payment method from the same screen. Click on Manage payment info to begin. Did you know you can now pay for Netflix without a credit card? Yup. Check out our simple guide.\nWhat About My Gift Cards and Promotional Balance Good news. You can continue to stream your favorite movies and series even after canceling your Netflix account if you have gift cards or other promotional balances left in your account. The subscription will end only after the balance runs out, no matter how long that takes. Once the balance runs out, you cannot access Netflix without restarting your membership.\nWhy Was My Card Charged After I Canceled Netflix The most plausible explanation could be that someone else with access to your Netflix Account restarted the subscription without your knowledge. Were you sharing your account details with someone? It is not uncommon for friends to share Netflix as it costs less. To save headaches, change your Netflix account’s password before canceling your subscription.\nCan I Cancel Netflix Before One Month of Free Trial Yes, you can but note that if you do not, at the end of the free trial, your card will be automatically charged. Then you can either continue watching or cancel immediately. Even after cancelation, you can still stream until the billing period ends.\nDoes Netflix Has a Refund Policy No. They state it clearly in their ToS, however, there have been exceptions. If you feel you were wrongly charged, you may try and contact them but don’t get your hopes high.\nCancel Netflix Netflix faces stiff competition from the likes of Prime, Apple TV, Disney, and Hulu. But Netflix is still Netflix and most people rely on it for their weekend binge-watching sessions. Have you tried the Netflix Party feature yet? It is pretty cool, especially with friends. And if you are a Discord user, hold on from unsubscribing from Netflix because you can now stream Netflix on Discord.\n","wordCount":"1452","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Howard Mason"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/posts/what-happens-when-you-cancel-netflix-subscription/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zefiliadwipa","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>SHOCKING: Your World Will Never Be The Same After Canceling Netflix Subscription -

Contact your senior or your billing company to check if they can cancel your Netflix subscription on your behalf.</p><h3 id=can-i-rejoin-netflix-and-if-yes-how>Can I Rejoin Netflix and If Yes, How<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#can-i-rejoin-netflix-and-if-yes-how>#</a></h3><p>Yes, you can easily begin your subscription again. All you have to do is open Your Account page in a browser and click on the Restart Membership button. Your Netflix membership will begin within seconds.
You will see a confirmation message.</p><h3 id=do-i-need-to-update-my-netflix-payment-details>Do I Need to Update My Netflix Payment Details<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#do-i-need-to-update-my-netflix-payment-details>#</a></h3><p>No, you don’t have to update payment details since Netflix already has it and maintains the same for up to 10 months. However, if you want to, yes, you can change your payment method from the same screen. Click on Manage payment info to begin.
Did you know you can now pay for Netflix without a credit card? Yup. Check out our simple guide.</p><h3 id=what-about-my-gift-cards-and-promotional-balance>What About My Gift Cards and Promotional Balance<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-about-my-gift-cards-and-promotional-balance>#</a></h3><p>Good news. You can continue to stream your favorite movies and series even after canceling your Netflix account if you have gift cards or other promotional balances left in your account. The subscription will end only after the balance runs out, no matter how long that takes. Once the balance runs out, you cannot access Netflix without restarting your membership.</p><h3 id=why-was-my-card-charged-after-i-canceled-netflix>Why Was My Card Charged After I Canceled Netflix<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#why-was-my-card-charged-after-i-canceled-netflix>#</a></h3><p>The most plausible explanation could be that someone else with access to your Netflix Account restarted the subscription without your knowledge. Were you sharing your account details with someone? It is not uncommon for friends to share Netflix as it costs less.
To save headaches, change your Netflix account’s password before canceling your subscription.</p><h3 id=can-i-cancel-netflix-before-one-month-of-free-trial>Can I Cancel Netflix Before One Month of Free Trial<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#can-i-cancel-netflix-before-one-month-of-free-trial>#</a></h3><p>Yes, you can but note that if you do not, at the end of the free trial, your card will be automatically charged. Then you can either continue watching or cancel immediately. Even after cancelation, you can still stream until the billing period ends.</p><h3 id=does-netflix-has-a-refund-policy>Does Netflix Has a Refund Policy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#does-netflix-has-a-refund-policy>#</a></h3><p>No. They state it clearly in their ToS, however, there have been exceptions. If you feel you were wrongly charged, you may try and contact them but don’t get your hopes high.</p><h2 id=cancel-netflix>Cancel Netflix<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cancel-netflix>#</a></h2><p>Netflix faces stiff competition from the likes of Prime, Apple TV, Disney, and Hulu. But Netflix is still Netflix and most people rely on it for their weekend binge-watching sessions. Have you tried the Netflix Party feature yet? It is pretty cool, especially with friends. And if you are a Discord user, hold on from unsubscribing from Netflix because you can now stream Netflix on Discord.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/posts/what-is-focus-status-on-iphone-and-how-to-turn-it-off/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>iPhone Users Beware: Your Device's Secret Focus Status Could Be Sabotaging Your Productivity - Here's How to Disable it Now!</span></a>

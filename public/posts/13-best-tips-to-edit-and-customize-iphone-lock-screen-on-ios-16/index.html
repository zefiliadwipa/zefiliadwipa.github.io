Create and Switch Between Multiple Lock Screens Prior to iOS 16, one could only have a single lock screen. All customizations had to be done on that lock screen only. But with iOS 16, you can create multiple lock screens and customize each one of them independently using the lock screen tips mentioned in this post. Here are the steps to create multiple lock screens on iPhone:\nOpen the notification panel on your iPhone. Touch and hold any empty space to enter the lock screen customization mode. If you want to customize the current lock screen, tap on the Customize button. To create more lock screens, tap on the (+) Add button. Then, select a wallpaper of your choice for the new lock screen. Tapping on either button in the previous step will take you to lock screen widget screen where you can add widgets, customize time font, and add filter or depth effect to the wallpaper. Make the necessary customizations. Then, hit the Done or Add button at the top. A pop-up window will appear. Tap on Set as wallpaper if you want to use the same wallpaper for lock and home screen. Alternatively, tap on Customize home screen to use different lock and home screen wallpapers. After setting up multiple lock screens, you can easily switch between different lock screens.

Tap the one that you want to set as your default lock screen. 2. Use Dynamic Wallpapers on Lock Screen Some of the wallpapers that are offered by Apple are dynamic in nature. That is, they change according to certain conditions. For instance, the Live weather wallpaper shows real weather on the screen as it is outside. So if it’s raining outside, you will see rain on the screen as well. Similarly, the Astronomy wallpaper changes throughout the day based on your time and location. Note: If the weather widget isn’t working on the lock screen, go to Settings \u003e Privacy and security \u003e Location services \u003e Weather. Select While using the app or widgets.

Tap on wallpaper to preview it. Hit the Add or Done button to use it.\n3. Customize Lock Screen Wallpaper You can customize the lock screen wallpaper by switching to its closer view, adding a filter to it, or changing the background color depending on the wallpaper used. For instance, you can switch to close up views in Astronomy wallpaper or add effects in other wallpaper. To do so simply swipe right or left on the screen where you add lock screen widgets while editing lock screen. Similarly, in solid color wallpaper, you can change the background color. For that, first, select the desired wallpaper. Then, swipe right or left to add an effect or tap on the Color icon to change the background color. Likewise, for emoji wallpapers, tap on the emoji icon at the bottom-right corner to select up to 6 emojis or swipe right or left to choose the emoji wallpaper style.

Add Depth Effect to Wallpaper Typically, when you add a photo wallpaper to the lock screen, the clock is always in the foreground hiding a small part of your photo. In iOS 16, you can add a depth effect to wallpapers, which simply puts the part of the photo in front of time, thus adding a 3D effect to the lock screen wallpaper. To do so, go to the screen where you can add lock screen widgets. Tap on the three-dot icon at the bottom and select Depth effect.\n6. Change Lock Screen Time Font You can easily customize the font of the clock on the lock screen. First, enter the lock screen customization mode.

The Font and color window will appear. Tap on the color that you want to set. Once you tap on a color, you can change its strength using the slider that shows up. Also, scroll to the extreme right side of the color list and tap on the Color palette icon. Here you can manually add a hex color code or choose from a wide variety of colors. Tap on the Color Picker icon at the top-left corner to select a color from your wallpaper. 8. Change Lock Screen Time Script iOS lets you choose from three different script styles for clock: Arabic, Arabic indic, and Devanagari. Follow these steps to change the time script:\nEnter the lock screen customization mode. Then, tap on the clock. In the Font \u0026 Color window, tap on the Globe icon. Choose a script that you want to use, 9. Add Widget Next to Date There’s no secret that you can add up to 4 widgets below the time on iPhone’s lock screen in iOS 16. However, did you know that you can add a widget next to the date right above the time as well? Just tap on the date on the widget screen in lock screen editing mode and the widget selection screen will show up. Tap on the widget that you want to use.

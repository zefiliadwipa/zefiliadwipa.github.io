WhatsApp has become an essential part of our lives, and we rely on this app to communicate with our friends, families, and colleagues. However, sharing sensitive information over WhatsApp can be risky, and you might want to keep your chats private. Fortunately, WhatsApp has introduced a new feature that allows you to send messages that self-destruct after a certain period.\nIn this article, we will guide you on how to self-destruct messages on WhatsApp in just two easy steps!\nStep 1: Download the Latest Version of WhatsApp The first step is to ensure that you have the latest version of WhatsApp. The self-destruct feature is only available in the updated version, so make sure you update the app before proceeding with the next steps.\nYou can check for updates in the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store.\nStep 2: Enable the Self-Destruct Feature Once you have updated WhatsApp, you can enable the self-destruct feature in just a few taps:\nOpen a chat with the person to whom you want to send the self-destruct message. Tap and hold the message you want to send as self-destructing. From the options menu that appears, tap on the clock icon with the number in it. Select the time interval from the options: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month. Hit the ‘SEND’ button. That’s it! Your message will now self-destruct after the time interval you selected. The recipient will receive a message saying “This message has been deleted” when the time runs out.\nSome Things To Keep In Mind Here are a few things to keep in mind when using this feature:\nSelf-destruct messages can only be sent in individual chats; you cannot use it in group chats. You cannot recall the message once it has been sent, so double-check the message before sending it. The recipient can still take a screenshot of the message before it disappears. The self-destruct feature does not ensure the privacy of the messages, as they can still be read by hackers or people who have access to your phone. In conclusion, the self-destruct feature on WhatsApp is a helpful tool to keep your chat history private, and it is easy to use once you have updated the app. However, it is not 100% secure, and you should keep sensitive information away from the app if you want to ensure complete privacy. We hope this guide helps you to revolutionize your WhatsApp game by sending self-destruct messages.\n1. Using Disappearing Messages Feature WhatsApp’s Disappearing messages feature works for both individual and group messages. It lets you send self-destructing messages. Any text, photo, video, sticker, GIF, etc., that you send while the Disappearing messages feature is on will disappear after the set time. You can choose to have messages disappear after 24 hours, 7 days, or 90 days of sending them.

Tap on the contact’s name at the top. You will reach the contact info screen. Scroll down and tap on Disappearing messages. Then, choose the time after which the messages should disappear from the chat.

Choose Only admins.Recipients can take a screenshot of disappearing messages and you won’t be notified about it.Older messages remain unaffected when you turn on Disappearing messages.\n2. Send Disappearing Photos Using View Once Feature The above method is a bit aggressive as everything disappears in the chat. What if you only want a photo or video to disappear from a chat? Thankfully, WhatsApp offers another cool feature known as View once that works for photos and videos only. As the name suggests, any photo or video sent using the View once feature will automatically disappear after the other person sees it. You cannot set a time period in this method. And, you will have to activate it every time you want to send self-destructing photo or video. Please keep in mind that other things will remain unaffected in the chat such as messages, stickers, GIFs, etc. To send a self-destructing photo or video on WhatsApp on Android and iPhone, follow these steps:\nOpen the chat where you want to send a self-destructing photo or video. On Android, tap on the Paperclip (attachment) icon and hit the Gallery option. On iPhone, tap on the (+) add icon and select Photo \u0026 video library. Select the photo or video to send. You will reach the photo preview screen. Here tap on the (1) icon at the bottom to enable the View once mode. Hit the Send button to send the photo. Once the receiver sees the photo, it will automatically disappear from the chat and they won’t be able to see it again. Few things to keep in mind while using the View once feature: Photos sent using the View once feature won’t be downloaded to the phone’s gallery.WhatsApp doesn’t send a notification if the other person takes a screenshot of a photo or video sent using the View once feature.You can only send a photo or video using the View once feature. GIFs, stickers, and documents, aren’t supported.\nWhat’s the difference between Disappearing messages and the View Once feature of WhatsApp? Everything in a chat disappears when you send messages using the Disappearing messages. On the contrary, only selected photos and videos vanish in View once mode. Furthermore, you can set a time period in the Disappearing messages feature, which isn’t possible in the View once mode. Lastly, disappearing messages can be turned off by others as well. This isn’t the case with View once. How to unsend a WhatsApp message? Touch and hold a message that you want to unsend. On Android, hit the Trash icon and select Delete for everyone. On iPhone, tap on the Delete button and hit the Delete icon. Choose Delete for everyone. The Best of WhatsApp WhatsApp offers many other hidden features similar to the ability to send disappearing messages.

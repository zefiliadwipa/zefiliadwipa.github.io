Thankfully, technology has come to the rescue with smartphone apps like Google Calendar and iPhone Calendar. These apps make scheduling and reminder-setting a breeze. However, not being able to sync the two can lead to missing appointments.\nWe have all been there; appointments that we forgot to add on one calendar, and leave us wondering why we didn’t get any notification until it was too late. That won’t happen again, we promise!\nWe’ve got some great news that will revolutionize your scheduling game – syncing your Google Calendar with your iPhone Calendar is more accessible than you might think.\nHere are three simple hacks that will help you sync your Google Calendar with your iPhone.\nSync Google Calendar with Apple Calendar App The Apple Calendar App is the default calendar app on your iPhone, but you can use Google Calendar on the app too. The first step is to log in to your Google account on your iPhone. Go to the Settings App, scroll down to “Mail, Contacts, Calendar” and click on “Add Account.” Select Google, then login to your account.\nOnce you’ve logged in, your Google Calendar will appear as an option in the Apple Calendar App. Suppose you want to add an event to Google Calendar. In that case, you’ll have to make sure you add the event under the “Google” option on the “Calendar” section of the app.\nSync Google Calendar on iCloud Another way to sync Google Calendar with your iPhone is through iCloud. This involves adding your Google account to your iCloud account. Once you do that, your events sync automatically.\nFirst, go to your iPhone Settings, click on your name at the top of the screen, tap “iCloud,” and toggle on the “Calendars.” Next, go to “Passwords and Accounts” and select “Add Account \u003e Google.” Once logged in, toggle on “Calendars.” After some time, your Google Calendar events will start to appear on your iPhone Calendar app.\nUse Third-Party Applications There are many third-party applications like Calendars 5, Outlook, Fantastical, or BusyCal that can help you sync your Google Calendar with your iPhone. These applications act as a virtual assistant that syncs and combines several calendars like Outlook, Google Calendar, and even Facebook Events.\nAfter downloading any of these apps, open the app, and connect to your Google Calendar account. You will be able to view and modify your Google events and receive notifications when an event is about to start.\nConclusion\nSyncing your Google Calendar with your iPhone Calendar reduces the stress of scheduling and helps you stay up-to-date with your appointments. Using the methods highlighted above, you can easily sync your Google Calendar events with your iPhone in minutes. Keep in mind, though, that syncing only works if you have a stable internet connection. So, make sure you check your connection before syncing your calendars.\nRevolutionize your scheduling game by implementing the above tricks, and never miss an appointment again!\n1.

Place your cursor over the calendar you want to add and tap on the kebab menu (three dots). Click on Settings and sharing. On the Settings page, scroll to Integrate calendar section and tap on the copy icon next to the “Secret address in iCal format”. Now send that link to the person’s iPhone.

The iPhone has revolutionized the way we send and receive messages, making it easier to keep in touch with our family, friends, and loved ones. However, there may be times when some conversations become too much to handle. Whether it’s a friend who won’t stop sending memes or a colleague who keeps spamming you with work-related messages, muting someone on iPhone messages can be a lifesaver. But did you know that there’s more to muting than just silencing notifications? In this article, we will explore the shocking truth about muting someone on iPhone messages.\nBody: Muting someone on iPhone messages has been a feature for a long time, but many users are unaware of what it can actually do. Here are some of the surprising things that you should know about muting:\nMuting a conversation only silences notifications While it’s true that muting a conversation will prevent your phone from buzzing every time the other person sends a message, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you won’t receive the message. If you open the messages app, you will still see the conversation, and you can still reply to the messages.\nYou can unmute a conversation at any time Muting someone on iPhone messages is not a permanent action. If you change your mind and want to receive notifications for the conversation again, you can easily unmute it. Just go to the conversation, tap on the “i” button on the top-right corner, and then toggle the switch next to “Hide Alerts.”\nThe person you muted won’t know that you’ve muted them Unlike blocking someone, muting them on iPhone messages doesn’t send them a notification, and they won’t know that you’ve muted them. This means that you can still maintain a civil relationship with the person without hurting their feelings.\nMuting a group conversation is different When you mute a group conversation, you won’t receive notifications for any messages sent in the group. However, any messages that are directed at you specifically will still appear as notifications.\nConclusion: Muting someone on iPhone messages is an effective way to deal with annoying or overwhelming conversations. It allows you to take a break from the conversation without hurting anyone’s feelings. However, it’s important to note that muting is not a permanent solution, and you should still try to address the issue with the other person if possible. As always, communication is key.\nMuting Message vs iMessage There is only one Messages app on your iPhone. If someone sends you a message from an Android phone, it is a text message. However, if someone sends you a message using an iPhone, it is an iMessage. iMessage functions inside the Apple ecosystem. It’s a walled garden after all.\nMessages sent to an Android phone, for example, will be in a green background but messages sent to an iPhone will be in blue background. Now, you can mute both kinds of senders on your iPhone Messages app, but it is useful to know the difference.\nHow to Mute/Unmute Someone on iPhone Messages The steps are easy enough to follow and wouldn’t take more than a few taps. Open the Messages app on your iPhone from the home screen or app library. Scroll to find the message that you want to mute. Tap and hold the message and swipe left to reveal a menu. Select Hide alerts option here. That would be the bell icon in a purple background. There will be a slash bar going through the bell icon indicating the alerts would be turned off for this sender. To unmute someone on iPhone Message app or to view alerts from someone, swipe left again and select bell icon again. This time, there won’t be a slash bar going through it indicating that you are enabling notifications from that user. You can hide alerts for both messages and iMessage the same way. Alternatively, you can also open the message, tap on the sender’s name at the top to open the Details menu, and hide/unhide alerts from that sender from there.\nHow to Know If You Have Muted Someone on iMessage When you open the Messages app, you should see a grey bell icon with a slash bar going through it on the right side. That indicates that notifications for all messages from that sender have been hidden. If the alerts are not hidden from a sender, then you will not see any icon on the right side of the message on iPhone. Also, this is true for both regular messages and iMessage.\nWhat Happens When You Mute Someone on iPhone Messages We know that both message and iMessage on iPhone have the same app. We also know how to mute and unmute a sender on iPhone Messages app. But what happens after that is still not clear. Allow me to shed some light on that.\nCan I Mute Group Messages Yes, you can mute individual as well as group messages on your iPhone. And this is true for both messages and iMessage.\nIs Muting the Same As Blocking Someone No. When you block someone on iPhone, you will not receive any messages from them. When you mute someone on iPhone, you will continue to receive messages from the sender.\nWill I Receive Message Notifications if I Mute Someone on iPhone No. You will not receive any pop-up or banner notifications on your iPhone’s home or lock screen if you have muted them in the Message app on iPhone. That is the whole purpose of hiding alerts. So you are not alerted about any message from them. You can still check their messages in the Message app.\nWill They Be Notified If I Mute Them on Messages or iMessages No. The sender of the message will not be notified if you have muted them. This is also true for iMessage even though both of you are part of the Apple ecosystem.\nCan I Mute Someone on Messages App on MacBook Yes. If you own a MacBook that is using the same Apple id as your iPhone, then you can mute anyone using the Messages app on your MacBook too. Simply launch the app on your Mac, open the conversation, and click on the i or info icon in the top-right corner to check the Hide Alerts option.\nFilter Messages from Unknown Senders You can also filter messages from random numbers that you have not saved in your contact list. To do that:\nOpen Settings \u003e Messages. Now tap on Unknown \u0026 Spam and toggle the Filter Unknown Senders option to on. Now, when you open the Messages app, swipe right from the left edge of the screen to find the filter options. Here you can filter messages by Known Senders and Unknown Senders. There are also Unread and All Messages filters that are self-explanatory. Can I mute contacts that are marked as my favorites? Yes. You can mute any contact saved in your phonebook. You can also mute anyone whose contact you have not saved yet. Can I mute and unmute contacts in bulk? No. There is no setting to select and then mute and unmute contacts in one go yet. However, with all the spam we get these days, that would be a welcome move. I see a crescent moon icon when I enable the hide alert option in Messages app. Why? That means you are running an older version of iOS. Either you need to update your iPhone or your iPhone is no longer eligible for updates. Apple offers OS updates for up to 5 years. Hide and Seek Muting someone on the Messages app on your iPhone is simple and easy. There are no repercussions and you can still view all messages from them by simply opening the Messages app. The only difference it truly makes is that it gives you some space and peace of mind as you no longer receive alerts for new notifications.\n","wordCount":"1351","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Philip Davison"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/posts/what-happens-when-you-mute-someone-on-iphone-messages/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zefiliadwipa","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://zefiliadwipa.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe the shocking truth about muting someone on iPhone messages - find out now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 8, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1351 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Philip Davison</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#muting-message-vs-imessage>Muting Message vs iMessage</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-muteunmute-someone-on-iphone-messages>How to Mute/Unmute Someone on iPhone Messages</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-know-if-you-have-muted-someone-on-imessage>How to Know If You Have Muted Someone on iMessage</a></li><li><a href=#what-happens-when-you-mute-someone-on-iphone-messages>What Happens When You Mute Someone on iPhone Messages</a><ul><li><a href=#can-i-mute-group-messages>Can I Mute Group Messages</a></li><li><a href=#is-muting-the-same-as-blocking-someone>Is Muting the Same As Blocking Someone</a></li><li><a href=#will-i-receive-message-notifications-if-i-mute-someone-on-iphone>Will I Receive Message Notifications if I Mute Someone on iPhone</a></li><li><a href=#will-they-be-notified-if-i-mute-them-on-messages-or-imessages>Will They Be Notified If I Mute Them on Messages or iMessages</a></li><li><a href=#can-i-mute-someone-on-messages-app-on-macbook>Can I Mute Someone on Messages App on MacBook</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#filter-messages-from-unknown-senders>Filter Messages from Unknown Senders</a></li><li><a href=#hide-and-seek>Hide and Seek</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Title: You Won&rsquo;t Believe the Shocking Truth about Muting Someone on iPhone Messages - Find Out Now!</p><p>Introduction:

With the official launch just around the corner, everyone is curious to get their hands on the new operating system. But did you know that you can be among the first to experience Windows 11, even before its official release? Yes, it’s possible through the Windows 11 Insider Program.\nThe Windows Insider Program is a community of technology enthusiasts who volunteer to test and provide feedback on upcoming Windows updates, features, and overall user experience. Microsoft collaborates with this community to gather insights and make necessary improvements before the final product launch. The Windows 11 Insider program is open to all, and you can join with a few clicks.\nIf you’re new to the Windows Insider program, you might have several questions. Don’t worry, we have got you covered. Here are some juicy secrets of the Windows 11 Insider program and all your questions answered.\nWhat is the Windows 11 Insider Program?\nThe Windows 11 Insider program is an initiative by Microsoft that allows enthusiasts and technology experts to test the upcoming operating system, provide feedback, and report bugs to improve the user experience. Insider members get access to exclusive Windows builds, and new features before a global launch. This also means that the builds are not fully polished and may contain bugs, so it’s not recommended to use these on your primary device.\nHow do I join the Windows 11 Insider Program?\nJoining the Windows 11 Insider Program is simple. All you have to do is register as an insider, download the Windows Insider Program app, choose the Insider channel you want, download the preview build, and install it on your device.\nIs it safe to participate in the Windows 11 Insider Program?\nParticipating in the Windows 11 Insider program is safe and secure, as Microsoft provides regular updates, and the company verifies all builds before release. However, we do recommend caution when using the insider builds on your primary device, as the builds may contain bugs, and you might experience crashes.\nWhat are the Insider Channels, and which one should I choose?\nThe Windows Insider program has different channels, and each channel offers various updates with varying degrees of risk. The three channels are:\nDev Channel - This channel is the most active, and members can access the latest builds with new features, enhancements, and steady stream of new code changes. However, these builds are untested, and they may contain many bugs.\nBeta Channel - This channel is better suited for people who want to access more polished builds that are stable and have been tested for bugs. Beta channels feature near-final builds that are ready for the public launch after thorough testing.\nRelease Preview Channel - This channel is tailored towards users who want the most stable and secure builds with minimal bugs. Members of this channel get access to the final release candidates before their official release.\nWe recommend choosing the Insider channel based on your comfort level and what you are looking to gain from the experience. For instance, if you’re a professional developer, the Dev Channel is well suited as you get the latest code changes.\nCan I leave the Windows 11 Insider Program?\nYes. Once you’re an Insider member and installed the Windows 11 Insider build, you can leave the program at any time by going to the ‘Windows Insider Program’ settings and clicking on ‘Stop Insider Preview Builds’.\nIn conclusion, participating in the Windows 11 Insider program is a great opportunity to get exclusive access to Windows 11 and its features before the final release. But remember, these builds are not meant for your primary device or daily use since they may contain bugs and crashes. That said, the Windows 11 Insider Program is a great way to participate in the larger Windows community and influence the Windows updates and new features by providing feedback. So what are you waiting for, join the Windows 11 Insider Program and become a part of the community!\nWhat Is Windows Insider Program Simply speaking, Windows Insider Program allows you, the end-users, enthusiasts, and developers, to peek inside Windows OS and test features before they are released to the general public. The insiders are then asked for their feedback on features, report software bugs, and security flaws or gaps that they discover which in turn helps Microsoft to release the next stable build for the masses. The users and developers benefit equally from this arrangement. Users get to try new features and share their thoughts while devs know what to expect so they can update their apps accordingly. And Microsoft gets to test the build before releasing it to their users. A win-win-win for everybody. When you join Windows Insider Program, two things will happen on your end: So how do you get early access to new Windows features using Inisder Program? Let’s find out.\nHow to Join Windows Insider Program I will be using Windows 11 OS for this guide but the steps should be more or less similar for Windows 10 users too. There are some prerequisites that you must fulfill before you can join Windows Insider Program though:\nYour computer must be running a licensed version of Windows 11.You must have access to an admin account.You must be signed into your computer using a Microsoft account. You cannot join Insider Program using a local account.Your desktop/laptop must be connected to a stable power source as this may take some time.Save all open work as your computer will reboot a few times during the process.\nNow, the steps.\nJoin the Windows Insider Program on the official website. Press Windows+I to open Windows Settings and go to Windows Update. Under Join the Windows Insider Program, click on Get started. You will see a pop-up asking you to link your Microsoft account to Windows Insider account. Click on Link an account. Choose a Microsoft account from available options. You may have added more than one to your computer. Click on the Continue next. You now get to choose your preferred Windows Insider channel. There are three but we recommend Beta Channel for most users. Select Dev Channel if you are a developer and know what you are doing. Beta Channel receives feature updates before Release Preview. This is called flighting and you can learn more about flighting on Microsoft. In the next screen, you will be asked to read the agreement and accept terms by clicking on Continue. Finally, you will be asked to reboot the computer. To do so, click on Restart now. When the computer reboots, go back to Settings \u003e Update and click on Check for updates. Now head over to Windows Insider Program inside Windows Update to check if there are any new Insider Preview builds available. Since this is your first, you will most probably have one. Click on Open Windows Update. Check for updates again and you should find a preview build. Download and install just like any other update. You may have to reboot your computer once the installation is complete. Follow on-screen instructions from here on. How to Leave Windows Insider Program Do you want to leave Windows Insider Program altogether or simply want to stop receiving Insider preview builds while still receiving emails about updates? Microsoft allows both.\nHow to Stop Receiving Insider Preview Builds You will no longer receive Preview updates delivered to your Windows computer. You will only receive the final build when it is ready and pushed for everyone else.\nPress Windows+I to open Settings and go to Windows Update \u003e Windows Insider Program and click on Stop getting preview builds to expand the menu. Toggle the Unenroll this device when the next version of Windows releases option to stop receiving new preview builds. Note: You will continue to receive Insider Preview Builds until the next major stable version of Windows is released to the general public. This is done to protect your computer from vulnerabilities and bugs found in the preview build. Alternatively, you will have to do a clean reinstall Windows 11 to exist Windows Insider Program immediately. There are more than one way to reinstall Windows 11. We recommend using Reset method from Advanced startup settings. Here is how that works. Note: Do take a backup of your data on OneDrive or external hard disk before moving forward. Press Windows+I to open Settings and then go to System \u003e Recovery and click on Restart now next to Advanced setup. Click on Troubleshoot option. Click on Reset this PC. Click on Remove everything. You may choose to select Keep my files option too but that may or may not sign you out of Windows Insider Program. Do try if you want though. You can either download a fresh copy of Windows from cloud or use one that’s available on your local drive. Downloading will take more time though. Select Only the drive where Windows is installed to do a clean install in the C drive. That way, your files in other drive will remain intact. Select Just remove files if you are in a hurry or Fully clean the drive if you have time and want to do delete files securely. The later will take more time. Finally, click on the Reset button and wait for the computer to boot. You will then set up your computer from scratch like select language, choose Wi-Fi, sign in to your Microsoft account, and so on. 1. Is Windows Insider Program Free? Can Anybody Join? Yes and yes. It is completely free to join, takes few minutes only, and anybody who satisfies the prerequisites we shared above can join Windows Insider Program.\n2. How Long Does It Takes for Preview Build to Appear? The first preview build should be visible in the Settings \u003e Updates section within seconds. Subsequent preview builds will be available as and when they are released by the Windows team.\n3. Can I Switch Channels Afterwards? Yes. Once you have joined a channel like Beta, you can go back to Settings \u003e Windows Updates \u003e Windows Insider Program \u003e Choose you Insider settings. Select your channel and then check for updates to receive new preview build.\n4. Where Do I Give Feedback on My Preview Build? Every Windows 10 and 11 computer comes preinstalled with an app called Feedback Hub. Sign in using the same Microsoft account that you used in Windows Insider Program and start exploring. You can rate your build and leave comments.\nInside Edge Being an Insider definitely has its pros. You get to play a part in shaping the next build or even major OS version of Windows. It increases your knowledge and brings you closer to industry veterans. However, there are cons too. These builds can be buggy and may break UI or cause app performance issues. But that’s part of the process and this is exactly what Windows devs are looking for. Anomalies that they can iron out with your help.

Note: Please make sure you’ve Google Drive and Google Docs installed on your iOS and Android devices so that you can seamlessly follow the steps below.

 
## What Is a Shared Folder


A Shared Folder is just a folder inside a Google Drive that has been shared with one or more users. Shared Folder gives multiple people access to the same folder so they can easily edit and collaborate on files saved inside it. You can easily convert a regular folder to a Shared Folder by following these steps. 
1. If you’re on the Web, open Google Drive in your browser, navigate to the folder you want to share > Right click > Get link > Restricted (under General access) > Anyone with the link > Done.
Pro Tip: After turning a normal folder into a shared one, tap on Copy link from the same pop-up menu to copy its link in the clipboard and then tap on Done to finish.
2. If you’re on iOS or Android, first open the Google Drive app. Navigate to the folder you want to share > kebab menu next to the folder > Manage access > Restricted (under General access) > Restricted > Anyone with the link.
Note: There are two types of Shared Folder in Google Drive. The first one that you’ll be creating will appear under the Files tab on mobile devices and in My Drive on the web. The second one, that’s being shared with you. You can find such folders in the Shared tab on mobile devices and Shared with me on the web.

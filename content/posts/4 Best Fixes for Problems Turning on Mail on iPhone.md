# Say Goodbye to Mail-Related Headaches with These 4 iPhone Fixes!

The iPhone is one of the best smartphones out there. It offers a seamless experience with its user-friendly interface and cutting-edge features. When it comes to managing email on your iPhone, things can get a bit tricky. While the iPhone's email app is excellent, it can also cause headaches for users. Here, we'll look at four iPhone fixes that can help you take control of your inbox and say goodbye to mail-related headaches!

## 1. Use Swipe Gestures to Manage Your Inbox

One of the most significant advantages of using an iPhone is its touch screen interface, which allows for intuitive navigation using gestures. Using swipe gestures in your email app can make managing your inbox a breeze. With swipe gestures, you can quickly triage emails by archiving, deleting, or marking them as read. To activate swipe gestures, go to Settings > Mail > Swipe Options and customize the gesture options to your liking.

## 2. Filter Your Inbox with Rules

If you're receiving hundreds of emails every day, chances are you struggle to manage them all. You can filter your inbox using rules, which categorize your emails into specific folders based on criteria you set. For instance, you can set up a rule that sends all emails from your boss to a specific folder for easy access. To set up rules, go to Settings > Mail > Rules, and then tap Add a Rule. From there, you can customize the rule to your liking.

## 3. Use the Unsubscribe Button

Do you often receive unwanted marketing emails? Most email apps, including the iPhone's default app, have an unsubscribe button that lets you unsubscribe from the sender's email list quickly. Instead of ignoring these emails or deleting them, an unsubscribe button helps you declutter your inbox and reduce the number of emails you receive. To use the unsubscribe button, tap on the sender's email, scroll down, and then tap unsubscribe.

## 4. Archive Old Emails

Over time, your inbox can get clogged up with old emails that you no longer need. Archiving old emails helps you declutter your inbox, improve its load time, and free up storage space on your iPhone. To archive an email, swipe left on it, and then tap Archive. Alternatively, you can tap on the email and then tap on the file icon at the bottom of the screen to archive it.

## Conclusion

Managing your inbox on your iPhone doesn't have to be a headache. With these four fixes, you can take control of your inbox and use it efficiently. Using swipe gestures, filters, unsubscribe buttons, and archiving old emails can help you streamline your workflow and boost productivity. Try using these iPhone fixes today and take control of your email!

## 1. Reboot Your Device


Many bugs in iOS can be fixed with a simple little reboot. Let’s start with that.
1. Hold the side button and either of the volume button until the Power Off slider appears. 
2. Drag the Slide to power off slider to turn off the phone.
3. Turn back the phone after one or two minutes by long pressing the side button for a few seconds.
Now try creating an iCloud email id again. 

 
## 2. Troubleshoot Connectivity Issue


There are still areas on our beloved planet where connectivity is still an issue. Starlink can’t come fast enough, eh? In that case, I would suggest you start with Wi-Fi. Here are some things to look at regarding the connectivity issue.

 
Check if you’re connected to the right network or not. Cause many times, our phones get connected to nearby open networks, which aren’t of good strength and we keep blaming our devices for the problem.If you are connected to the right network and still facing issues, then check if that Wi-Fi has an active plan or not. This is a common culprit for many internet-related issues and goes unnoticed often.
 
## 3. Turn On/Off Airplane Mode


If you are not connected to Wi-Fi but using your sim’s data plan, check whether your sim has an active data plan or not. If yes, then you should try this.
1. Go to Settings.
2. Toggle on Airplane Mode.
3. Toggle it off after a few minutes.

 
## 4. Sign Out and Back Into Your Apple Account


Last, but not least. if you are still facing issues when turning on mail on Apple, try signing out and back into your device. Here is the process to properly do so.
1. Go to Settings. Tap on your name/AppleID. Tap on Sign Out.
2. Type your Password in the text field and tap Turn Off. Then on the next page, tap on Sign Out.
3. Go back to the Settings main page, and tap on Sign in to your iPhone. Type your email and password and then tap on Next.
4. A pop-up will appear on the screen asking you to enter the verification code. Enter the verification code and you’ll be signed back on your iPhone.
Note: You will get the verification code on your other Apple device with the same Apple ID signed in as a pop-up. If not, you might get it as an SMS.
1. If iCloud mail cannot be enabled on iPhone, as a quick solution, can we use it in a browser on icloud.com too?
No, iCloud can only be turned on on Apple devices. Once turned back on, you can sign in to iCloud Mail on any choice of your browser.
2. Can I create a second iCloud email id or do I need to if I am using Gmail to create an apple id?
You can’t create a second iCloud email id. One Apple ID allows one iCloud email id.
3. What about 3rd party email apps like Spark? Can those be used to access iCloud Mail in this situation?
Yes, you can access your iCloud Mail on any third-party mail client but only after the same has been enabled and created using an Apple device.
4. What if I created an apple Id with my Gmail id? Which is my iCloud mail or is it created automatically? If yes, where do I find it?
Your Gmail ID is your AppleID and the iCloud Mail you created is an alias for your Apple ID. iCloud Mail isn’t created automatically. Here are the steps to turn it on manually.

 
## Wrapping Up


iCloud is an integral part of the Apple ecosystem which can help you organize emails and files quickly when used efficiently. I hope this helped you fix the problems you were facing when turning on mail on your iPhone. Meanwhile, iOS has many unique features such as Spatial Audio and Photo Cutout, which you might wanna check out to get more out of your iPhone.

Title: You'll Be Shocked by What Really Happens When You're Blocked on Discord!

Discord is a popular communication app that is used by millions of people worldwide. It has become an essential tool for many gamers, communities, and organizations to stay connected and communicate with each other. However, there are times when people may have to block each other due to several reasons. It could be due to harassment, personal conflicts, or simply to prevent any further communication. So, what really happens when you're blocked on Discord? Let's find out!

What is Blocking on Discord?

Blocking is a feature that Discord provides to its users to prevent others from sending them direct messages or friend requests. When you block someone on Discord, they will not be able to message, send friend requests or even join your server if you have one. They will also not be able to see your status, username, or profile picture.

What Happens When You're Blocked on Discord?

If you are blocked on Discord, there are a few things that may happen. Firstly, you will not be able to send any messages, friend requests, or call the person who blocked you. Secondly, you will not be able to see any messages or activity from that person on the servers you both share. Thirdly, you will not be able to join any server that the person who blocked you is managing or moderating.

If you have been blocked, you may receive a message notification that the person you tried to message is no longer available for direct messaging. However, if you share a server, you may still be able to see their name in the member list of the server. But, you will not be able to see their profile picture, status, or any activity.

What Happens to Your Messages When You're Blocked?

If you have sent messages to the person who blocked you, those messages will still be visible in the server where they were sent. However, those messages will only be visible to other users who can still see the blocked person's activity. The person who has blocked you will not see those messages, and they will not receive any notification about them.

In some cases, you may also receive a message from Discord saying that your message could not be delivered due to the recipient blocking you. This message means that the person you sent the message to has blocked you, and they will not be able to see or receive any messages from you.

How to Find out If You're Blocked on Discord?

If you suspect that you have been blocked on Discord, there are a few ways to confirm it. Firstly, try sending a message to the person who you suspect has blocked you. If the message does not go through, then you may have been blocked. Secondly, try joining a server where the person you think has blocked you is a member. If you're not able to join, then you have likely been blocked.

Conclusion

In conclusion, getting blocked on Discord can be frustrating and confusing. However, it is essential to understand that blocking is a feature that is provided for the safety and privacy of Discord users. If you have been blocked, you will not be able to send messages, call, or friend request the person who blocked you. But, you can still enjoy using Discord with other users and participate in exciting activities that the platform has to offer. If you suspect that you have been blocked, try some of the methods mentioned above to confirm it.

## How to Block Someone on Discord


Blocking someone on Discord is easy. You can block someone on Discord from multiple places like the Discord text channels, friends list, server members, search results page, direct messages page, etc. In short, once you found their username on Discord, it just takes a couple of steps to block them from there. 
1. Click on their username or avatar (profile pic) from DM, friends list, or on any mutual server chat.
2. In the pop-up, click on their avatar to access their profile.
3. Here, click on the three-dot menu and select the Block option. 
This should block that particular user instantly. You can follow a similar process on the Discord smartphone app too. 

 
## What happens When Someone Blocks You on Discord


When someone blocks you on Discord, you will not receive a notification for the same. Instead, Discord quickly removes the ability to connect with each other.

 
### 1. You Cannot Send Direct Messages


Discord, by default, allows sending direct messages to anyone who shares a mutual server with you even when they are not on your friend’s list. If a user blocks you, you can still send messages, but your message will not be delivered. Instead, you will get a reply message from Clyde, a Discord bot, saying that ‘Your message could not be delivered’.
But you can still pin messages or even react to messages with emojis on both DM and text channels in servers (reacting to messages is possible only before someone blocks you). Note that the messages you sent after getting blocked will not be delivered after he/she unblocks you. 
But before jumping to conclusions, there can be many reasons for this behavior if you are not already friends on Discord. The user might have left the mutual server, so you lost the direct-message functionality. The user might have set to receive messages only from friends.

 
## 2. Will Not be Available on Your Friend’s List


If you get blocked on Discord, it will automatically remove you from their friend list. Hence, you cannot find them on your list either. To check that, open Discord, click on the Discord icon at the top left corner and select the Friends option. You should find a list of all your friends here. Search for the user and if he/she isn’t available, they might have blocked you. 
However, there is a chance that they have simply unfriended you.

 
## 3. Cannot Send Friend Requests


If you are blocked by any user on Discord, you can no longer send friend requests to that user. You can crosscheck this by clicking on their avatar to open their profile. Here, you should see Send Friend Request button. 
When you click on it, you should get a popup saying Friend Request Failed. 
Just like sending messages, there could be other reasons behind this behavior. Discord, by default, provides an option to send friend requests to everyone. But, the user can restrict it to friends of friends or only to server members. They can also choose not to receive friend requests from anyone. So if you are not able to send friend requests on Discord, the user might have just disabled it.

 
## 4. Cannot View Their Bio


Along with the inability to send friend requests, you can’t check their bio in their profile either. You will be still able to look at your mutual servers, mutual friends, and even the avatar (profile pic), but not the bio. I think because it is more personal in nature.
Again, same as in previous situations, we cannot be sure as they can just remove the bio or might not even have one at all.

 
## 5. Text Messages in the Server Will Be Hidden


If someone blocks you on Discord, your messages will be hidden from them even on the server chat. But, they have the option to view the message if they want to. This can help them follow the conversation in the text channels and also not show the messages by default.
However, if you got blocked by someone, you can still view their messages normally. This only affects the person who blocked you, so that they don’t have to deal with messages. 
However, there will be no difference in voice channels, you and the user who blocked you can join a voice channel and chat just as before. If anything, you can mute each other manually every time he/she joins a voice channel.

 
## How to Tell If Someone Blocked You on Discord


As you can see, there are a few ways to check if someone blocked you on Discord but these situations don’t guarantee the same. Their DM can be closed, their friend request option can be disabled, they might not have a bio on their profile, and so on. But if you are experiencing everything we shared above then chances are you are blocked. Because it is highly unlikely they changed all these settings at the same time. 
Another way to see if they blocked you, or not, is by checking their profile from another Discord account. If you can see their bio and send messages and friend requests, you can be 100% certain that they have blocked you and it’s not just a coincidence.

As we all know, we sleep our computers after a certain period of inactivity to save power and prolong battery life. The sleep mode is a useful feature of Windows computers that automatically puts the computer into a low power consumption mode. But did you know that this mode has hidden effects that could potentially harm your computer and its performance?

In this article, we’ll explore the hidden effects of sleeping your Windows computer that you never knew!

## Cache & Ram

When your computer is in sleep mode, the cache and RAM are still active. This means that your computer is still processing data, and in turn, creates heat. This heat can cause damage to the internal components of your computer and shorten their lifespan.

Furthermore, the data that is stored in the cache affects the overall performance of your computer. If you sleep your computer regularly, the cache and RAM will become cluttered with unnecessary data, resulting in sluggish performance and reduced speed.

## Updates

Windows computers regularly receive updates that require restarting the computer. If your computer is in sleep mode when an update is being installed, it will not properly install, and the system may become corrupted. This could potentially result in data loss or permanent damage to your computer.

## Battery Life

Sleep mode was designed to save battery life when the computer is not in use. However, the constant sleeping and waking up of your computer can have a negative effect on the battery’s overall lifespan. Over time, this can cause the battery to degrade faster and reduce its overall capacity.

## Security

If your computer is in sleep mode, it may still be vulnerable to potential security threats. Although the computer is not actively being used, the network connection is still active. This means that if a hacker gains access to your network, they can potentially access your computer and steal sensitive information.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, sleeping your Windows computer may seem like a harmless feature, but it can have hidden effects on your computer’s performance, lifespan, and security. To ensure the longevity of your computer, it is recommended to shut it down completely. This will clear out any unnecessary data stored in the cache and RAM and prevent any potential security threats.

Remember, prevention is always better than cure. Take care of your Windows computer to ensure it lasts for years to come!

## What Happens to Your Apps and Unsaved Work


When Windows enters sleep mode, it saves all your apps and unsaved documents on your PC’s RAM. So, when you wake your PC from sleep, it can bring up all your apps, programs, and other unsaved documents in no time.

 
## What Happens if Your Laptop Runs Out of Battery During Sleep Mode


In the event that your laptop or tablet is about to run out of battery, Windows will automatically save all your unsaved work to the hard drive and shut down the system. So, you won’t lose any of your work when you power it back on.
However, if you have a desktop PC, you might be better off using the Hybrid Sleep option. This mode allows Windows to save your work in memory as well as your hard drive. So, if there’s a sudden power failure, you won’t lose your unsaved work. 
To enable hybrid sleep on Windows, you’ll need to configure your PC’s power plan by following the steps below.
1. Press the Windows key + S to open the search menu, type in edit power plan, and press Enter. 
2. Next, click on Change advanced power settings.
3. Navigate to Sleep > Allow hybrid sleep. Then, use the drop-down menus next to On battery and Plugged in to select On. Then, click on Apply.

 
## How Does Sleep Mode Save Battery


During sleep mode, only your PC’s RAM requires power to stay functional. Since other elements such as the screen, processor, and hard drive are turned off, your PC requires very little power to operate.

 
## When Should You Use Sleep Mode 


Sleep mode can come in handy if you’re planning to leave your Windows PC for a short period of time. For instance, if you’re taking a break and plan to return to work in a few hours, you should put your PC to sleep rather than shutting it down.
By putting your computer to sleep, you allow components like the screen, battery, and hard drive to catch a break. Since these components have a limited life cycle, using sleep mode helps increase their lifespan.

 
## When Should You Not Use Sleep Mode


Although sleep mode has its benefits, in some cases, it does make sense to shut down your PC completely. For instance, if you’re not going to use your PC for a few days or if you only use it for an hour or two daily, it’s best to shut down your PC or hibernate it. 

 
## 3 Quick Ways to Put Your Windows PC to Sleep


Here are some quick and easy ways to put your Windows PC to sleep.

 
### 1. Use the WinX Menu


Probably the easiest way to put Windows to sleep is via the WinX menu. To do so, right-click on the Start icon, go to Shut down or sign out and select Sleep.

 
### 2. Use Keyboard Shortcut


If your Windows PC has a dedicated sleep button (crescent moon or a Zz icon), you can enable sleep mode by pressing that button in conjunction with the function key on your keyboard.

 
### 3. Use the Power Button or Close the Lid


Lastly, you can also configure your Windows to enter sleep mode when you close the lid or press the power button. To do so, press the Windows Key + S to open the search menu, type change what closing the lid does, and press Enter.
In the System Settings window, use the drop-down menu next to When I press the power button to select Sleep for both On battery and Plugged in. Then, click on Save changes. Similarly, you can also configure Windows to enter sleep mode when you close the lid. 
You can wake your PC from sleep simply by moving your mouse, pressing the power button, or opening the lid.

 
## Good Sleep, Healthy Aging


Using sleep mode is quite beneficial and has no adverse effects. In fact, you should consider putting your PC to sleep instead of shutting it down completely if you plan on using it in the next few hours. This way, you can avoid wear and tear caused by frequent shutdowns and startups.

# Shocking Discovery: Reinstalling Your Favorite App Could Change Your Whole Mobile Experience!

Have you ever thought of reinstalling your favorite app to get better results or to have a better user experience? If not, then it's time for you to try it out. You might be amazed at how reinstalling an app could entirely change the way you use it.

Reinstalling the app can help fix the issues you might be facing with the app. It can also help you get rid of the bugs, glitches or corrupt files that might have been causing problems with the app.

Reinstalling is an excellent option when the app starts to run slow or begins to crash often. By reinstalling, we get the opportunity to start afresh with the app as if we are using it for the first time, without losing any of the data, provided we have our app data backed up.

Also, in some cases, reinstalling an app might get you the latest version of the app. Often, you might not receive the update for the app, or the app developer might not push the latest version due to some technical limitations. Reinstalling the app can help you get the update and provide you with a better user experience.

The process of reinstalling the app is simple. Go to the app store or play store and find the app you want to reinstall. Then click on the uninstall button and wait for a few seconds for the app to uninstall completely. After that, click on the install button to reinstall the app. Within minutes, you have your favorite app up and running again.

However, it is essential to make sure that you have backed up all the important data before uninstalling the app. This is especially important if the app involves sensitive data like chat history, photos, or videos. You can either take a backup of your data manually or use an app that automatically backs up your data to a cloud account.

In conclusion, reinstalling your favorite app can indeed change your entire mobile experience. It can help you get rid of any problems you might be facing and provide you with a newer and better version of the app. So, the next time you face any issues with your app, give it a try and reinstall it before thinking of other options. It might just be the solution you were looking for!

## What is Meant by Reinstalling an App


Reinstalling an app simply means uninstalling the app from the phone and then installing it back. For the unaware, uninstalling an app means to completely delete the app from the phone. You will have to install the app again on your phone if you want to use it. The installed app will behave and look like you installed it the first time. That is, you will have to set up the app again.
On iPhone, you can offload the app as well instead of completely uninstalling it. Offloading the app will only delete the storage used by the app but keep the app data. Therefore, you can still access the app data when you reinstall the app after offloading it. You can consider offloading the app as a slightly tweaked version of uninstalling the app.
Now, that you know the meaning of reinstalling an app, let’s check what happens by reinstalling an app.

 
## What Happens by Reinstalling an App
 
### App Data


Data is the main thing that you might worry about when reinstalling an app. The final result regarding data varies from app to app. For some Android apps, the data is completely removed from the phone. However, for others, you might still be able to reuse the data when you reinstall the app. On the contrary, you won’t able to reuse the data when you reinstall an app on your iPhone.
App data refers to the data stored locally on your phone. It doesn’t mean your social media profiles, posts, or messages. Such things will remain intact even after reinstalling the app because they are stored on the service provider’s servers. Basically, any data that is synced to an online account will not be affected by reinstalling the app.

 
### App Settings


The app settings are reset i.e., restored to default values when you reinstall the app. You will have to set the settings again in the app after reinstalling the app.

 
### Login Details


Reinstalling an app will make you log out of your account. You will need to sign in again with your account username and password after reinstalling the app.

 
### Paid Apps


You don’t have to pay again if you reinstall a paid app. That is, you can use the apps that you had earlier bought on Play Store or App Store without paying again. However, make sure you are using the same account to download and log in to the paid app you used earlier.
If it was a one-time purchase, you own the app forever. If the app has a subscription model, you can use the app until you pay, usually monthly or yearly.

 
### Storage


Uninstalling an app removes the app data, cache, and user data. So, yes, reinstalling the app will free up some storage space on your phone.

 
## Examples of Reinstalling Apps
 
### Gallery App


You cannot reinstall the pre-installed gallery apps like Google Photos or Apple Photos. However, if you have installed a third-party gallery app on your phone, reinstalling it will not delete photos or videos from your phone.

 
### Facebook and Facebook Messenger


When you reinstall the Facebook or Messenger app, you will have to log in again to your Facebook account. Your Facebook profile, posts, messages, and other things will remain unaffected by reinstalling the apps. However, changes made to the app settings like notifications, permissions, etc., will have to be set again.

 
### Instagram


Similar to Facebook, you will have to log in again to your Instagram account after reinstalling the app. Your Instagram profile and associated data like followers, the following list, messages, etc., will not be deleted by reinstalling the app. Moreover, any photo or video that you downloaded from Instagram will also not be deleted

 
### WhatsApp


When you reinstall WhatsApp on Android, you can restore your chats from a local backup or from Google Drive provided you created a backup before uninstalling the app. On the contrary, you will be able to restore chats on iOS after reinstalling WhatsApp only if you saved the backup to iCloud.

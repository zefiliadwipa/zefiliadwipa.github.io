# STOP Interrupting Your Productivity! Discover the Hidden Power of 'Do Not Disturb' on Your iPhone NOW!

As a society that embraces constant connectivity, we tend to be easily distracted by our smartphones, causing great obstruction to our work and productivity. While it may seem necessary to check your phone every few minutes, it’s quite the contrary! Instead, adapting to the ‘Do Not Disturb’ feature on your iPhone can help you to combat unnecessary disruptions, offering a more focused and peaceful work environment.

First of all, let’s discuss the technicalities of the ‘Do Not Disturb’ feature. This feature allows us to peruse our phones, without having to worry about the constant interruptions, dings, or vibrations of our phones. Not only can you force your phone to silence, but it also automatically rejects calls and other notifications, making it a great tool for reducing stress and work distractions. It's important to note that the feature can be customized to your unique needs, allowing specific contacts or important calls to come through despite the setting.

One of the most valuable benefits of ‘Do Not Disturb’ is that it gives you the permission to focus your attention on your task at hand. This means you can dive into your project, concentrate on writing that report, or dedicate yourself to a particular assignment without the interruption of notifications. By eliminating distractions, you increase your work efficiency and productivity, allowing you to achieve top-notch results in record time.

Apart from productivity, ‘Do Not Disturb’ maintains tranquility in our day-to-day lifestyle. It’s important to retreat from technology once in a while, and this particular feature helps us to achieve that goal. By enabling the feature, you can structure a few minutes or hours of undisturbed quiet time to catch up on overdue assignments or engage in mindfulness practices.

In addition to the aforementioned benefits, ‘Do Not Disturb’ can be a fantastic tool for improving our relationships. For example, during a family dinner or a friend’s birthday celebration, enabling the feature allows you to give your full attention to those around you, establishing deeper relationships and connections with those important to you.

In conclusion, the ‘Do Not Disturb’ feature is a fantastic tool that can benefit anyone seeking to improve their productivity and overall wellness. Not only does the feature decrease stress levels and improve focus, but it can improve relationships and well-being too. Those who are constantly barraged with notifications, text messages, and calls should consider enabling the feature for certain times of day or for specific tasks. With a mere tap of a finger, you can achieve greater productivity, tranquility, and focus - enabling you to perform at your personal best.

## Where Is Do Not Disturb on iPhone


In the latest versions of iOS, Do not disturb mode is part of Apple’s new feature known as Focus, which debuted in iOS 15. Therefore, you will find Do not disturb under Focus settings on iPhone. Open Settings on your iPhone, go to Focus and here you will find Do not disturb. Tap on it to customize it. 
Focus modes, for the uninitiated, are a collection of profiles that will assist you in silencing calls, alerts, and notifications on your iPhone based on the conditions specified. Do Not Disturb is one of the Focus modes now. Other Focus profiles include driving, fitness, reading, meditation, and so on. You can even create your own Focus profile that is tailored to your specific needs. Check out the best tips to use and customize Focus modes on iPhone. 

 
## What Has Changed in Do Not Disturb on iOS 16/15

However, one important feature that is missing in DND is that you cannot keep DND mode disabled while using the phone or when unlocked. This was possible earlier and helped users in getting notifications while using the phone or keep them silenced when iPhone was locked.
Furthermore, the Do not disturb while driving feature can be found under the Driving Focus now i.e., Settings > Focus > Driving. You must enable and customize it separately from the standard Do not disturb mode.

Title: SHOCKING: Your Phone's Do Not Disturb Mode May Be Sabotaging Your Social Life!

Introduction:
Do Not Disturb mode on our phones was introduced with the intention to help us concentrate on our work or a good night's sleep without being distracted by the constant notifications from our phones. However, it seems that this feature has not proven to be as beneficial as we might have thought. In fact, it might even be sabotaging our social life! As an AI language model, I would like to discuss this topic that affects our daily lives and how we can use our phone's features more effectively to avoid social isolation.

Body:
It's a common feature for smartphone users to enable the 'Do Not Disturb' mode when they're in meetings, studying or even while driving. With the rise of social media and messaging apps that make it possible for people to stay connected and updated in seconds, notifications can be overwhelming and a distraction from the task at hand.

However, what we might not realise is that this feature can also hinder our social life. You might be wondering how a feature designed to reduce distractions could possibly sabotage your social life? Let's dive in.

Social isolation is a growing problem in our modern society. The UK government has recently appointed a Minister of Loneliness to tackle the issue. With the pandemic and lockdowns, people are already experiencing more isolation and loneliness than ever before. Enabling the Do Not Disturb mode for longer periods can add to our social isolation.

When you enable the 'Do Not Disturb' feature, you might miss out on important messages and calls from loved ones, friends, or colleagues. While it may sound like mere FOMO (fear of missing out) at first, there can be negative long-term effects. You might end up losing touch with people, missing out on social events, or even losing out on job opportunities if you don't respond in a timely fashion.

Using Do Not Disturb mode for long periods can turn into a habit that's hard to break. It's not uncommon for people to enable it for several hours or even days without actually needing to. When you disable the feature, it's easy to get flooded with notifications that have been waiting for you. This might lead to you feeling overwhelmed and discouraged to respond, which will again lead you to a social disconnection.

Conclusion:
While Do Not Disturb mode can be beneficial in balancing our work and personal life, it's important to remember that it can also have negative consequences. To avoid social isolation, we should look at how we use the feature and be mindful of how long we keep it on. Instead of relying on this feature as a long-term solution, it might be better to create a routine or allocate specific times for checking our phone notifications to stay connected with the outside world. Through these measures, we can enjoy the fruits of technology without losing touch with our social connections.

## What Happens to Incoming Calls, Text Messages, and Other App Notifications When DND Is Active


Even when DND mode is enabled, you continue to receive calls, text messages, and other notifications on your phone. The only difference is that your phone will not ring or vibrate in response to those calls and notifications. You’ll see all those missed calls, text messages, and notifications when you use your phone. 

 
## Can I Make Calls, Send Messages, and Use Apps While Do Not Disturb Is Active


Yes, you can make calls, send text messages, and use apps as you’d normally do. Enabling DND has no effect on any of those activities.

 
## Will Others Be Able to Tell if I Enable Do Not Disturb on My Phone


No, others will not be able to tell if your phone is in DND mode. When someone calls you, their call will go to voicemail as usual. The only time people can tell your phone is on DND is when you use it while driving because it sends an automatic message.

 
## How to Enable or Disable Do Not Disturb on Android and iPhone


Now, let’s see how you can enable or disable DND mode on your Android and iPhone. 

 
### How to Enable DND on Android


Although we’ve used a Samsung phone for this article, the steps below will work on most Android devices.
1. Open the Settings app and navigate to Notifications > Do not disturb. If you don’t see the Do not disturb option, use the Setting app’s search bar to find it.
2. Turn on the switch next to Do not disturb. 
3. You can also configure your phone to activate DND on schedule. For that, tap on Add schedule. Type in a name for your DND profile and define when it should kick in. Then, tap on Save. 
Once created, you can enable or disable this profile from the Do not disturb menu. 

 
### How to Enable DND on iPhone


1. Swipe down from the top right corner of the screen to bring up the Control Center. For older iPhones, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to pull up the Control Center.
2. Tap on Focus and then tap on Do Not Disturb to enable it. 
3. If you want to schedule Do Not Disturb to activate automatically, tap the kebab menu (three-dot menu) next to the Do Not Disturb option and select Settings. 
4. Under Turn on automatically, tap on Add Schedule to configure Do Not Disturb to activate automatically based on time, location, or app usage.

 
## How to Allow Someone to Bypass Do Not Disturb on Android or iPhone


Although DND mode provides peace of mind, you may not want to miss calls or text messages from important people. Thankfully, you can allow calls and messages from specific people to ring even when DND is activated. Here’s how:

 
### Add Exceptions for DND Mode on Android


1. Open the Settings app and navigate to Notifications > Do not disturb.
2. Under Allowed during Do not disturb, tap on Calls and messages. Tap on Add contacts and add people who can reach you while DND is active. 

 
### Add Exceptions for DND Mode on iPhone


1. Open the Settings app and navigate to Focus > Do Not Disturb.
2. Under Allow Notifications, tap on People and add contacts who can reach you while Do Not Disturb is active. 

 
## Why Does My Phone Ring Even When Do Not Disturb Is Turned On


On the iPhone, DND is set to allow calls through if the same number calls again within three minutes. This allows you to receive urgent calls even if DND is turned on. If you wish, you can disable this feature on your iPhone. To do so, head over to Settings > Focus > Do Not Disturb. Toggle off the switch next to Allow Repeated Calls.
Similarly, an Android phone may ring while in Do Not Disturb mode if the same person calls twice within 15 minutes. To disable this setting, go to Settings > Do Not Disturb. Tap on Calls and messages and toggle off the Repeated callers option. 

 
## Difference Between Do Not Disturb and Focus Mode on iPhone


Starting with iOS 15, the Do Not Disturb mode is now a part of the Focus feature on iPhone. You can think of Focus mode as a more advanced version of Do Not Disturb mode, with more options. For instance, Focus mode gives you control over what your home screen and lock screen should look like when you use specific Focus profiles.

 
## Does Do Not Disturb Mode Work Across Multiple User Profiles on Android


Most Android phones support multi-user mode, allowing multiple users to use the same phone with different settings. If you enable DND on your phone and then switch to another user profile, your Android will follow the settings defined by the other user. So, if the other person has disabled DND for their profile, DND will be disabled when you switch to that profile.

 
## No More Disturbance


Do Not Disturb is an excellent feature to use when you want to disconnect from the outside world and focus on your work. Aside from Do Not Disturb, there are numerous focus apps that can help you stay away from your phone.

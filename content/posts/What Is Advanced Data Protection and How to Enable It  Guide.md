# Unlock the Secret to Unbeatable Data Security with Advanced Protection - Your Step-by-Step Guide Inside!

Data security is one of the most critical concerns for businesses and individuals alike. With the increasing threat of cyberattacks, it's more important than ever to protect your sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands. Hackers and cybercriminals are continually evolving their tactics, and traditional methods of data protection are no longer enough. That's where advanced protection comes in.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps you need to follow to unlock the secret to unbeatable data security. So, let's get started!

## Step 1: Assess Your Current Security Measures

Before you can improve your data security, you need to know where you stand. Assess your current security measures, including firewalls, antivirus software, and password policies. Look for any gaps or weaknesses in your system that could be exploited by hackers. Take note of the weaknesses you find and prioritize the ones that need to be addressed first.

## Step 2: Implement Advanced Protection Solutions

There are several advanced protection solutions you can implement to improve your data security. Two-factor authentication is one of the most effective methods, as it requires users to provide two pieces of evidence to verify their identity. Biometric authentication is also becoming increasingly popular, with fingerprint and facial recognition technology commonly used to secure devices.

Another essential solution is encryption. Encryption scrambles data into an unreadable format that can only be decrypted with a specific key. This way, even if hackers access your data, they won't be able to read it without the key.

## Step 3: Train Your Employees

Employees are often the weakest links in data security, which is why it's essential to train them regularly. Provide them with the knowledge and skills they need to recognize and avoid common cyber threats like phishing and malware. Teach them how to create strong passwords and regularly change them. Encourage them to report any suspicious activity or possible security breaches.

## Step 4: Monitor Your System

Regular monitoring of your system is critical to detecting and addressing any security threats quickly. Utilize security tools like intrusion detection systems and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions to monitor your network and devices. Set up alerts for suspicious activity and take prompt action if necessary.

## Step 5: Stay Updated

Lastly, it's crucial to stay updated on the latest cybersecurity trends and threats. Cybercriminals are continually developing new methods to breach security systems, so staying informed is essential. Regularly update your security software and install patches as soon as they become available.

In summary, data security is a vital aspect of modern-day life. Following the above steps and implementing advanced protection solutions will help you stay ahead of cybercriminals and keep your data safe. Remember to assess your current security measures, implement advanced protection solutions, train your employees, monitor your system, and stay updated. With these steps, you can unlock the secret to unbeatable data security.

Note: At the time of introduction, Advanced Data Protection was only available to USA users. But now it has been made available for Indian users also. Please update your iPhone or iPad to get access to this feature and then proceed with the steps to activate it on your device.

 
## What Is Advanced Data Protection


Whenever an iPhone user stores his/her data on iCloud, it is prone to attack by malicious hackers. The data may include sensitive photos and videos, contacts, messages, health data, keychain passwords, and much more. This is where Advanced Data Protection comes to the rescue. Advanced Data Protection provides end-to-end encryption to the “vast majority” (why vast majority and not all, more on that below) of most sensitive iCloud data which can only be decrypted on your trusted Apple devices i.e, your iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Thus providing the utmost security to user data.
In case you’re wondering, iCloud already protects 14 sensitive data i.e, passwords in keychain, health data, payment information, messages in iCloud, Apple card transactions, Home data, and much more by providing end-to-end encryption. But the Advanced Data Protection is expanding the list from 14 to 23. Now, turning it on will also encrypt your iCloud backups, Photos, Notes, Voice memos, etc. Here is the full list of services that are encrypted under Advanced Data Protection.
So what does “vast majority” of data mean? Apple uses that phrase because some data like iCloud Mail, Contacts, and Calendar need to interoperate with the global email, contacts, and calendar systems. So encrypting such data might result in an unwanted user experience.

 
## How Does Advanced Data Protection Work


Let’s first understand how Apple’s Standard Data Protection works in order to get a hold of Advanced Data Protection. For anything that uses Apple’s Standard Data Protection first, the data gets encrypted and then a key is generated. Then the data and its keys both are stored in Apple’s iCloud server. So if someone with ill intentions gets access to Apple’s iCloud server might abuse your sensitive data, as both the keys and data are stored in the same place. 
But Advanced Data Protection works in a different fashion. It sends end-to-end encrypted data to iCloud which can be decrypted only on your trusted devices i.e, where your private keys are stored. So even if someone gets a hold of Apple’s iCloud server, all they will get is a big pile of a jigsaw puzzle that only you have the keys to solve.

 
## Important Stuff Related to Advanced Data Protection


Advanced Data Protection is an added layer of security for iCloud. Due to this, even Apple can’t peek into your data which can create a problem while recovering data from a locked-out iCloud account. To deal with such unpleasant situations, you need to consider three things so that you can never get locked out of your device.

 
## How to Enable the Advanced Data Protection


To use Advanced Data Protection, you need to set a Recovery Contact or turn on the Recovery Key on your iPhone first. You can choose to go with either one of them or may enable both, in case one doesn’t work out for you in the future. First, let’s look at the steps to enable Advanced Data Protection by adding a Recovery Contact.

 
### 1. Turn on Advanced Data Protection by Adding a Recovery Contact


1. Open Settings on your iPhone and tap on name/Apple ID.
2. Tap on iCloud to begin.
3. Now tap on Advanced Data Protection.
4. Tap on Turn on Advanced Data Protection.
5. On the next page tap on Set Up Account Recovery.
Note: This step is for those who haven’t set up their Account Recovery yet. If you have already set up the Recovery contact or Recovery key on your iPhone, then skip to step 14.
6. On the Account Recovery page tap on Add Recovery Contact.
Note: If you want to proceed with Recovery Key, we will cover steps for later.
7. Tap on Add Recovery Contact.
8. Type the name of the person whom you want to add as a Recovery Contact. It might be your siblings, spouse, family, friends, etc. Once the contact of the person appears, tap on it to select it.

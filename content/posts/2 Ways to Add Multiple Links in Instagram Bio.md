You Won't Believe How These 2 Techniques Can Expand Your Instagram Bio Link Capabilities!

As an Instagram user, you know how crucial your bio is for driving traffic to your website, blog, or any other platform you want your followers to visit. With the limitation of only one clickable link in your bio, you need to make every click count. But what if we told you that you could expand your Instagram bio link capabilities?

With two techniques, you can optimize your bio link and extend its reach beyond the single website link provided by Instagram. In this article, we'll discuss these techniques and how you can benefit from them.

Using Link Shorteners

Most marketers suggest using your own domain to maximize your credibility and branding. However, if you want to add more links to your bio and don't want to miss out on traffic and clicks, we suggest using a link shortener.

Link shortening services like bit.ly and Rebrandly can help you create shortened URLs for each page you want to promote. You can then add these links to your bio, and your followers can click on them to visit the desired landing pages. This technique can help enhance your promotion strategies and drive more traffic to your favored sites.

Using Link Tree

Linktree is a tool that allows you to add several clickable links to your Instagram bio. When your followers click on your Linktree link, they'll be directed to a dashboard with all your clickable links that you've added.

With Linktree, you can include your YouTube channel, your product page, your blog, your social media accounts, and any other site you want your followers to engage with. This way, you can make do with the one clickable link provided by Instagram and still have access to several other links. Plus, it's easy to use and only takes a minute to set up.

Conclusion

Your Instagram bio link isn't just an afterthought; it's your chance to guide your followers toward your business, website, or blog. By using link shorteners and Linktree, you can enhance your promotion tactics, extend your reach, and take advantage of the limited one clickable link in your Instagram bio.

Try out these two techniques today and see how they can help your brand grow on Instagram!

## 1. Using Instagram Native Feature


Earlier, Instagram allowed only one link in the bio. But that has changed. Now, you can add more than one link to your Instagram bio.
Note: While some users are able to add multiple external links, at the time of writing, I could only add one external link and links to my Facebook account and group.
Here are the steps to add multiple links to your Instagram bio:
1. Open the Instagram app on your Android or iPhone.
2. Tap on the profile picture icon at the bottom to go to your profile screen.
3. Tap on the Edit profile button.
4. Tap on Links.
5. Press the Add external link button.
6. Add your website and give it a name. Tap on the Done button to confirm.
7. If your account allows adding more external links, you will see the Add external link button again. Tap on it and add the second link. Alternatively, to add Facebook links, tap on Add Facebook link. You will be asked to set up the Accounts center. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the accounts center. Then, finally, you can add the link to your Facebook account and any group that you manage.
This is how multiple links will look in your Instagram bio:

## 2. Using Third-Party Services


If the above method doesn’t work for your Instagram account or you don’t like it, you can use free third-party services to add multiple links to your Instagram bio. These services give you one custom URL so that you can add it to your Instagram bio. Now here’s where things get interesting. The custom URL is basically an external page where you can add unlimited links.
Picture this – you put one link in your Instagram bio and when a user opens the link, she/he will be greeted by a simple page with multiple links of your choice.  
Be assured that these services are easy to use and do not require any technical knowledge. The premium versions of these services even allow you to customize the layout of the landing page and password-protect links among other features.

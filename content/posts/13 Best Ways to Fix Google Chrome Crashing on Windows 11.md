Is Your Google Chrome Constantly Crashing on Windows 11? Try These 13 Proven Fixes Now!

Google Chrome is one of the most popular web browsers worldwide. It is widely used due to its speed, user-friendliness, and excellent performance. However, Google Chrome is not exempted from technical malfunctions. One of the most frustrating experiences for Google Chrome users is constantly crashing on Windows 11. If you are one of those facing this issue, don't despair. Below are 13 proven fixes to try now!

1. Update Chrome to the Latest Version

The first step in troubleshooting the Google Chrome crashing issue is making sure that you are running the latest version of Chrome. Chrome releases frequent updates to fix bugs and improve performance. To update your browser, click on the three-dot menu at the top right corner of Chrome. Then navigate to "Help" and click on "About Google Chrome." Chrome will check for updates, and if available, click the "Update" button.

2. Clear Browsing Data

Sometimes, accumulated browsing data such as caches and cookies can cause Chrome to crash. Clearing up these data can help you fix the issue. On the Chrome browser, click on the three-dot menu and choose the "More Tools" option, then select "Clear browsing data." Ensure that you select the checkbox for "Cached images and files" and “Cookies and other site data" then click "Clear data."

3. Disable Browser Extensions

Chrome extensions are useful in enhancing functionalities while browsing. Some, however, can cause conflicts leading to constant crashes. Try to disable extensions, especially third-party ones, to troubleshoot the problem. Go to the Chrome menu and click on "More Tools" then "Extensions." Toggle the Enable or Disable switch for the extension(s) you want to disable.

4. Disable Hardware Acceleration

Hardware acceleration is a feature that utilizes your computer’s GPU to speed up web browsing. However, it can be a source of conflict leading to the Chrome crash issue. To disable hardware acceleration, go to the Chrome menu, click "Settings," then "Advanced." Under "System," toggle off the "Use hardware acceleration when available" switch.

5. Create a New User Profile

A corrupted user profile can cause Chrome to crash constantly. To fix this, create a new user profile on Chrome. Click on the three-dot menu, choose "Settings," then "People." Click "Add person" and assign a new name to the profile. Switch to the new profile and check if the issue persists.

6. Reset Chrome Settings

Resetting Chrome settings can help you fix the issue if it's caused by configuration problems. Go to the Chrome menu, click on "Settings," then "Reset and clean up." Choose the "Restore settings to their original defaults" option then click on "Reset settings."

7. Disable Service Workers

Service workers are scripts that run in the background that help web pages load faster. However, disabling them can help resolve browser issues like crashes. To disable service workers, type "chrome://flags" in the address bar, then search for "Service Worker." Disable the option for "Service worker background fetch" then "Serviceworker Payment Request". Relaunch the browser to apply the changes.

8. Remove Fast Start-up Option

Fast start-up mode can cause a conflict between Chrome and Windows 11, leading to numerous crashes. Disabling this feature can resolve the issue. Go to "Settings," then "Power and Sleep," click on "Additional power settings," then choose "Choose what the power button does." Click on "Change settings that are currently unavailable," then uncheck "Fast startup."

9. Run Chrome in Compatibility Mode

If the issue persists, try running Chrome in compatibility mode. Right-click on the Chrome icon, choose "Properties," then go to the "Compatibility" tab. Tick the "Run this program in compatibility mode" option, then choose "Windows 8" or "Windows 7" from the drop-down menu.

10. Disable and Re-enable Chrome

Sometimes disabling and enabling Chrome can help resolve the issue. To disable Chrome, open the "Task manager" by pressing "Ctrl-Shift-Esc." Locate Chrome, right-click on it then select "end task." After a few minutes, open the browser to re-enable it.

11. Turn Off Chrome Flags

Chrome flags are optional experimental features that can be enabled to improve the functionality of the browser. However, they can lead to Chrome crashes. Disabling Chrome flags can resolve the issue. Type "Chrome://flags" in the address bar, then reset all the flags to default.

12. Disable Autofill

Autofill is a feature that saves login credentials, addresses, and other data for future use. However, it can cause Chrome to crash frequently. To disable autofill, go to "Settings," then "Autofill," then "Addresses and more," then "Payment methods." Disable autofill features in the individual sections.

13. Run Chrome in Safe Mode

Running Chrome in Safe Mode can help diagnose the source of the issue. Press "Windows key + R," type "chrome –safe-mode," press Enter. When prompted, click "Yes" to open Chrome in Safe Mode. If the browser works in Safe Mode, there may be an issue with the extensions, hardware acceleration, or third-party apps.

In conclusion, constant Chrome crashes on Windows 11 can be an annoying challenge. The above-discussed fixes are proven to help you troubleshoot Chrome and get up and running. However, if all these do not work, consider reinstalling Chrome, or seek technical assistance.

# Discover The Ultimate List Of Windows 11 Browsers - Boost Your Internet Experience Now!

As Windows 11 is slowly rolling out to users worldwide, many are excited about the new features and improvements which come along with it. One of the most important aspects of any operating system is the browser, which is used for accessing the internet and browsing web pages.

In this article, we will explore the ultimate list of Windows 11 browsers, which can help you enhance your internet experience substantially.

## Microsoft Edge

Microsoft Edge is the default browser that comes with Windows 11. It has undergone a significant overhaul from its predecessor, making it more secure, faster and feature-rich. One of the most noticeable improvements is the integration of Microsoft's Chromium browser engine, which enhances the browser's performance and compatibility.

Other notable features include a built-in tracking prevention mechanism, a more robust password manager, and a sleek interface that appeals to users. With these new additions, Microsoft Edge is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a versatile and reliable browser for their Windows 11 system.

## Mozilla Firefox

Mozilla Firefox is another popular browser that has been recently updated for Windows 11. It offers an array of features and customization options to make your browsing experience more enjoyable. Firefox offers a faster page-loading speed and more robust privacy features.

Firefox offers built-in support for various add-ons and extensions, enabling users to customize their browsing experience to their liking. Furthermore, the browser's built-in password manager ensures that your login information is secure and encrypted, which is helpful for anyone concerned about online privacy.

## Google Chrome

Google Chrome is arguably the most popular browser worldwide, and it's no surprise that it has been optimized for the new Windows operating system. It offers a user-friendly interface and lightning-fast page-loading speeds, positioning it as the ideal browser for anyone who values speed over most other features.

Chrome's built-in password manager and automatic updates provide additional security measures to ensure that your browsing experience is always safe and secure. Also, the browser's seamless integration with Google services, such as Google Drive and Gmail, makes it an attractive choice for regular Chrome users.

## Opera

Opera is a lesser-known browser that offers a range of features to make your browsing experience enjoyable. It's user-friendly interface, and built-in VPN ensures that your internet activity is secure, and your data is safe from prying eyes.

Opera offers a battery saver mode, which is ideal for laptop users, and a built-in news feed for updates on the latest news and events. Additionally, the browser offers an integrated messaging service, which enables you to remain in touch with your friends and colleagues while browsing.

## Vivaldi

Vivaldi is a relatively new browser that offers an array of customization options to enhance your browsing experience. It offers powerful tab management, which enables you to group and organize tabs for easy access.

Apart from being customizable, Vivaldi's built-in privacy features, such as the ad blocker and built-in tracker blocker, offer an extra layer of security to your internet activity. Additionally, Vivaldi's speed dial system ensures that your favorite websites are readily accessible, making browsing a breeze.

## Conclusion

In summary, Windows 11 offers users an incredible range of browsers from which they can choose. Whether you're looking for a fast browsing experience, a more secure web experience, or just an altogether enhancing internet experience, there is a Windows 11 browser that suits your needs.

No matter which browser you choose, ensure that you update it regularly to avail of the latest features and security updates. With the right browser choice, you can now take your browsing experience to exalted heights.

Let’s begin.

 
## 1. Google Chrome (Most Popular, Largest Ecosystem)


Google Chrome is the most popular Windows 11 browser in the world and with the largest market share too. Chrome browser runs on the Chromium engine, a free and open-source initiative that is used by many other browsers covered in this guide. While Google has done an impressive job at developing the Chrome ecosystem with a large repository of extensions, Chrome is marred by sluggish performance and frequent lags and crashes.
Chrome is also known to be a resource hog, especially when you have multiple windows and tabs open. A quick look at the Task Manager will tell you all you need to know about RAM and other resources it is consuming. But still, Chrome is a first and solid choice for most users.
Chrome benefits from Google’s large ecosystem of apps like Search, Translate, dates, currency converter, etc. So you can solve simple math problems or perform quick searches right in the address bar without having to open a site or even Search.
Pros:

 
Privacy and security focusedCreate QR code for any pageCast to deviceTranslate, Lens, Search, etc. worksBenefits of Google’s ecosystemSearch, convert, translate, etc. right inside the address barSearch Google Drive from Chrome address bar directlySend page to synced devicesPassword and credit card manager


Cons:

 
Resource intensive on RAMLags and hangs frequently


Download Google Chrome

 
## 2. Microsoft Edge (Balanced Replacement for Chrome)


Microsoft finally got over IE and launched Edge, a Chromium-based browser that benefits from the large extension database of Chrome but mostly none of its drawbacks. Edge is quite fast and in my personal experience, has never lagged. Because it is a Microsoft product, it integrates with Microsoft apps, just like Chrome does with Google apps.
Microsoft Edge browser for Windows brings some interesting features like web capture to take and annotate screenshots on any page on the fly, solving on-screen math problems, and choosing between three different privacy profiles to name a few.
Just like Chrome, Edge also benefits from Microsoft’s suite of apps and is capable of performing several tasks right inside the address bar.
Some interesting things I noted. Edge can’t translate words in Bing like Google does in Chrome. However, Edge can solve even complex math problems on any website or webpage.
Pros:

 
Create QR code for any pageCast media to deviceSolve on-screen math problemsSuggests coupons when shoppingThree Privacy profiles to choose fromWeb capture to take and annotate screenshotsBenefits of Microsoft’s ecosystemSend page to synced devices


Cons:

 
Can’t search OneDrive from EdgeCan’t translate on the fly


Download Microsoft Edge

 
## 3. Brave Browser (Private Browser That Pays You)


Brave is a privacy and security-focused Windows 11 PC browser, but it is also web 3 and a crypto-native one. It was founded by one of Firefox’s co-founders and so privacy and security are part of its ethos. We have covered Brave browser before pitting it against Chrome, Vivaldi, and even Firefox and each time it came out stronger.
Brave blocks ads and trackers by default. You see, Google’s business model was built on advertising so it can’t help but show ads and that requires collecting and selling user data. Brave chose a decentralized web with its own crypto token and advertising model.
Interestingly, Brave has a revenue split program called Rewards. Basically, you can choose to view ads if you want and the revenue earned by Brave will be split between them and you. Get paid to browse. By default, this is turned off which is good. Revenue will be credited to your crypto wallet and paid in their native token Brave.
It also integrates TOR’s world-class privacy feature and uses DuckDuckGo as the default search engine to enhance your privacy online. Over the years, Brave has grown its product lineup.
But because Brave is still a new player, it cannot compete with the resources or ecosystem of Google or Microsoft. However, because it was built on Chromium, it does benefits from it.
Pros:

 
RewardsSearch engineTalk – Video calling appCrypto walletVPNPrivacy-focusedNative tokenChromium-based


Cons:

 
Lacks ecosystem benefits of Edge and Chrome


Download Brave Browser

 
## 4. Opera (Free VPN With a Catch)


Opera is quite a feature-rich Chromium browser for Windows 11. One of the primary features is a free VPN that can be set to 4 different regions. But as the famous proverb goes, if there is no product, you are the product. Free VPNs make money by selling your data so forget privacy. They recently introduced paid plans beginning at $1.99/month though.
Another interesting feature is the ability to use messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, among others, right in the sidebar. No need to keep them open in separate tabs now. It saves time and makes life easier. Also supports music streaming apps like Spotify.
Pros:

 
Multiple workspacesMessaging apps in sidebarMusic streaming apps in sidebarCrypto walletBuilt-in ad blockerBuilt-in CalculatorFlow to share files/URLs between devicesVPN (Freemium)Screenshot tool


Cons:

 
Slightly bloated


Download Opera

 
## 5. Opera GX (Gaming Browser or Fad)


Another browser from Opera, GX is focused on gamers. In fact, Opera has a number of browsers for Windows users to choose from making it slightly confusing. For example, Opera supports crypto wallets, however, there is a dedicated Web 3 browser too!
I would say GX should be considered if you are into light-browser gaming on Windows 11. For everything else, there is Steam and dedicated desktop apps like MSI Afterburner and Rivatuner among many others. GX will add some fancy bookmarks to sites that a gamer may visit, a red theme that screams gamer, and tools in the sidebar to limit CPU, RAM, and Network. The limiter functionality might come in handy while playing in-browser games.
Pros:

 
RAM, CPU, Netowork limiterScreenshot toolGaming themes/wallpapersGX Corner – gaming news, deals, etc.Messaging apps in sidebarMusic streaming in sidebarShare files and URLs between devicesGaming calendarAd-blockerFreemium VPNCrypto wallet


Cons:

 
No workspaces


Download Opera GX

 
## 6. Firefox (Fighting Losing Battle)


The only non-Chromium Windows 11 browser on the list, Firefox is slowly losing out to Chrome and all the other browsers that its browser engine helped spawn. What that means is if Firefox loses and has to shut down, Google dominates the browser industry and that is important because browsers are how we access the world wide web.
Privacy and security were Firefox’s selling points until others started offering features that simply made life easier. Firefox was forced to up its game with offerings like the ability to edit PDF inside the browser itself, Eye Dropper that will identify color codes, and a few more.
But the primary selling point remains a privacy-focused secure Windows browser that is not owned or even related to Google remotely. If you take a look at Firefox’s product lineup, it becomes more obvious. There is a VPN, Monitor that will tell you if your email address was part of known hacks, and Relay that works like Apple’s own iCloud Email Relay.
Firefox has an important role to play but seems to be lagging behind. Too little, too late? Probably, but when it comes to privacy and security, it is second to none.
Pros:

 
Built-in ad blocker Color pickerDev toolsDedicated Facebook ContainerScreenshot toolPDF editorVPNMonitorRelay


Cons:

 
Doesn’t support many popular extensions/add-onsSometimes sites don’t load correctly


Download Firefox

 
## 7. Safari (Try and Buy)


Talking about privacy and security, Safari is the go-to browser for most inside Apple’s walled garden, or as Apple calls it, ecosystem. Outside, Apple decided to stop offering support for Safari in 2015. You can still download the old version on Windows 11 but it is not recommended. So no joy for Windows users unless you simply want a taste of it before you move to macOS for good. That’s the only reason it made the list. Read on, nothing to see here.
Download Safari

 
## 8. Vivaldi (Endless Customizable)


Vivaldi takes a leaf out of Opera and tries to distinguish itself in a sea of Chromium browsers on Windows by adding features and customizations. The good thing is that it allows you to choose how much clutter you want in your UI.
I went for fully loaded because that’s one way to truly experience the browser on my Windows 11 machine. The setup process is clean and clear and takes you through features, security, privacy, etc.
Like Brave, it displays the number of ads and trackers blocked. Like Opera, it has a functional sidebar where you can find interesting and useful features like notes, tasks, and a mail client. The UI can be customized infinitely (which is where it shines) and however, you want from the position of tabs to the sidebar, menus, and everything in between.
Vivaldi is for those who like to control every single aspect of their Windows browsing experience right from the position of the address bar to keyboard shortcuts. And Vivaldi doesn’t disappoint.
Pros:

 
Customizable keyboard shortcutsUI is flexible and customizableView multiple pages Tab managerNotes TasksMail clientCalendarTranslation toolRSS feedsIn-built ad blocker


Cons:

 
So many settings/options can be overwhelming


Download Vivaldi

 
## 9. Slim (Lightweight and Fast)


We saw browsers with privacy and security on the mind. We saw browsers with features and customizations on the mind. We also saw browsers for Windows with web 3 and crypto on the mind. Slim takes all that away to offer the lightest browser for Windows 11 you can find. It does nothing else which means it opens quickly and loads pages fast. 
It does have a download manager that allows you to download packets in parallel. There are a few other addons available that enable features like sharing pages directly to Facebook and Twitter but that’s it.
Pros:

 
Ad blockerDownload managerAddons


Cons:

 
Too basic and simple for modern browsing


Download Slim

 
## 10. TOR (For privacy and Security Fanatics)



Download Impervious

 
## 11. TOR


TOR is the gold standard of privacy and security. TOR or The Onion Router uses something called multi-layered encryption where your traffic is moved through a series of servers to mask the source IP. Just like how an onion has multiple layers.
However, because traffic and data are moved through as many as three servers, the result is slow loading times. TOR doesn’t offer any of the fancy features we saw in some Windows browsers above. No. It was designed from the ground up to do one thing – offer the best privacy to the end user.
As such, TOR is not your ordinary browser and neither are its use cases. TOR is used to browse the dark web, journalists who are reporting on war, and so on. It is designed with specific use cases in mind.
Pros:

 
Private and secureEncrypted trafficBlocks ads, trackersResist fingerprinting


Cons:

 
Slow loading speeds


Download TOR

 
## Browsers for Windows 11


Here is the breakdown.
Go for Edge if you are deep into the Windows ecosystem. Use Brave browser if you are into crypto and web 3 but also value your privacy and security equally. Opera and Vivaldi will offer way too many features than you know what to do with and that’s not a bad thing. Most of you won’t need TOR unless you really want to protect your identity at all costs. I still like Firefox and it has an important role to play but sadly, it is on the decline. I do hope it makes a strong comeback.
Chrome remains the OG with its large ecosystem with Google’s full might behind. It is also the most popular one out there. But sometimes, it lags and disappoints and when it comes to privacy and security, Chrome is far behind the likes of Brave, for example.

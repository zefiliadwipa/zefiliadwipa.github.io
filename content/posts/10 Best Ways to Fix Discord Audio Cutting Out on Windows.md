Say Goodbye To Audio Issues on Discord: Top 10 Game-Changing Fixes for Windows Users!

Discord has become an integral part of every gamer's life. It is the go-to app for many gamers when it comes to communicating with their friends while playing games. Discord not only lets you communicate with your friends via voice chat but also allows you to share your screen and even stream games. However, there are times when you may face audio issues while using Discord on Windows. These issues can be quite frustrating and can often disrupt your gaming experience. In this article, we will take a look at the top 10 game-changing fixes for audio issues on Discord on Windows.

1. Update Discord:

This may sound like an obvious solution, but it's worth mentioning. Make sure that you have the latest version of Discord installed on your Windows machine. Sometimes, outdated software can cause audio issues. Updating Discord may resolve the issue.

2. Adjust Input Sensitivity:

Discord has a feature called input sensitivity. It allows Discord to automatically detect when you're speaking and adjust your microphone settings accordingly. However, if the input sensitivity is too high or too low, you may face audio issues. To adjust input sensitivity, go to User Settings > Voice & Video > Input Sensitivity. Set it to automatic or manually adjust it by speaking into your microphone and watching the input sensitivity level.

3. Change Server Region:

If you're facing audio issues, it may be because of a bad server connection. Discord has servers all around the world, and connecting to a server that is far away from your location may cause audio issues. To change the server region, click on the server name on the top-left corner of your Discord screen, and select a server region that is closer to your location.

4. Enable or Disable Exclusive Mode:

Windows has an audio feature called "Exclusive Mode." It allows an app to take exclusive control of your audio device. Discord may not work properly with this feature enabled. To disable Exclusive Mode, right-click on the speaker icon in the taskbar > Sounds > Playback > Select the audio device and click on "Properties" > Advanced Tab > Uncheck "Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device."

5. Clear Discord Cache:

The cache is a component of an application that stores temporary data. Over time, the cache can become corrupted, causing audio issues on Discord. To clear Discord cache, go to User Settings > App Settings > Scroll down and click on "Clear Cache."

6. Disable Audio Enhancements:

Windows has a feature called "Audio Enhancements." It enhances the sound quality of your audio device. However, it may interfere with Discord and cause audio issues. To disable Audio Enhancements, right-click on the speaker icon in the taskbar > Sounds > Playback > Select the audio device and click on "Properties" > Enhancements Tab > Check the box that says "Disable all enhancements."

7. Check Firewall Settings:

Firewall settings may sometimes interfere with Discord, causing audio issues. Check your firewall settings and make sure that Discord is allowed to access the internet. To do this, go to Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall > Click on "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall."

8. Check Voice Settings in Discord:

Discord has voice settings that can adjust the volume, input device, and output device, among other things. Make sure that these settings are set up correctly. To access Voice Settings in Discord, go to User Settings > Voice & Video.

9. Reinstall Audio Drivers:

Outdated or corrupted audio drivers can cause audio issues on Discord. To reinstall audio drivers, go to Device Manager >> Sound, video and game controllers >> Right-click on the device and click on "Uninstall device". Restart the computer, and Windows will automatically reinstall the drivers.

10. Disable "Noise Suppression":

Discord has a feature called "Noise Suppression." It cancels background noise while you're speaking. However, it may also cancel out your voice. If you're facing audio issues, try disabling this feature. To disable noise suppression, go to User Settings > Voice & Video.

In conclusion, these are the top 10 game-changing fixes for audio issues on Discord on Windows. Try these solutions one by one until you find the one that works best for you. With these fixes, you can say goodbye to audio issues on Discord and enjoy seamless gaming with your friends.

## 1. Check the Network Connection


If you are dealing with a sketchy network connection on your Windows PC, Discord audio may cut out during an active call. You need to connect your computer to a stable Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection and try again.
If your computer has Wi-Fi issues, check our dedicated guide to fix Wi-Fi not working on Windows 11. Once you confirm double-digit speeds (in MBPS) on fast.com, start a group call on Discord without any audio issues.

Discord audio may fail to work due to a denied microphone permission. You need to enable microphone access to desktop apps.
1. Press Windows + I keys to open Windows Settings.
2. Select Privacy & security from the sidebar and select Microphone.
3. Now nable the toggle for Let desktop apps access your microphone.

 
## 3. Check Your External Microphone

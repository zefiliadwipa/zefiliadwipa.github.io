# Desperate to revive your expired Whatsapp? Check out these 4 life-saving fixes NOW!

If you are a regular Whatsapp user, you would understand the feeling of despair when you realize that your account has expired. This can be a critical situation, especially if you have important conversations and personal information stored within the app. But worry not! Here are 4 life-saving fixes that can help you revive your expired Whatsapp account.

## Fix 1: Renew your Whatsapp account

The first and most obvious solution is to renew your Whatsapp account by subscribing to its services. This can be done by following a few simple steps. Firstly, make sure that you have an active internet connection on your phone. Secondly, go to the Whatsapp homepage and click on the "Renew Now" button. Lastly, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the subscription process. Once you have successfully renewed your account, all your old conversations and data will reappear in your Whatsapp account.

## Fix 2: Change your phone's date and time settings

Another common reason for Whatsapp expiring is due to incorrect date and time settings on your phone. This can easily be fixed by adjusting the date and time settings to automatic or manually setting them to the correct time zone. To do this, go to your phone's settings, click on date and time, and change preferences accordingly.

## Fix 3: Clear Whatsapp app data on Android

If you are an Android user, one reason why your Whatsapp account may have expired is because of corrupted data. This can easily be fixed by clearing the app data. To do this, go to your phone's settings, click on apps, then Whatsapp, and finally click on "Clear Data". After this, try opening Whatsapp again and check if your account has been revived.

## Fix 4: Reinstall Whatsapp

If all else fails, the last resort is to reinstall Whatsapp. Before doing this, make sure to backup your Whatsapp data such as conversations and contacts. After this, uninstall the app from your phone, go to the Google Play Store or Apple Store, and reinstall Whatsapp. Once it is installed, restore your backed up data and log in to your account.

In conclusion, an expired Whatsapp account can be a stressful situation, but with these four life-saving fixes, you can quickly revive your account and regain access to all your important conversations and data. Remember to renew your subscription, check your phone's date and time settings, clear app data, and reinstall Whatsapp as a last resort.

Let’s begin.

 
## 1. Update WhatsApp


This is the primary reason why you are seeing the ‘This version of WhatsApp version has expired’ message on your screen. Since WhatsApp requires you to sign in to your web and desktop app using a QR code scanned from the mobile app, first update the mobile apps.
You can download and/or update the latest version of WhatsApp on Play Store, App Store, Microsoft Store, and macOS App Store. You can also open these app stores on your devices and search for the app to update them directly. You will see the Update button if there is an update available. Otherwise, you will see an Open button.

If you are using WhatsApp in a browser, you may see the update option in the left sidebar. Click on Click to update WhatsApp button. 
If you don’t see the update button while using WhatsApp Web, simply close the tab, open WhatsApp Web again in a new tab and sign in again by scanning the QR code using the mobile WhatsApp app as you did before. That will load the latest version of WhatsApp in your browser automatically.

 
## 2. Clear Cache and Data


Sometimes, old data associated with an app may hamper the performance of the app leading to weird issues like the one you are facing. Clearing cache and data may help.
Clear Browser Cache
1. Press F12 on Chrome, Edge, or any other Chromium-powered browser. That should activate Deev Tools. You will a pop-up asking for confirmation. Click on Yes/Allow if asked. In Edge, click on Open DevTools button.
2. Now right-click on the reload or refresh button and select Empty cache and hard refresh. That will delete cache files and reload the tab automatically. You may have to sign in to WhatsApp again.
Clear Mobile Cache
There is no way to clear cache data on iPhone or iPad. But you can clear app data and cache on Android.
1. Open Settings app from the app drawer and go to Apps > WhatsApp.

2. Tap on Storage and then select Clear cache at the bottom of the screen.

Again, you may have to sign back into WhatsApp. However, since WhatsApp takes regular backup of your chats, everything should be okay. Also, there is also an option to Clear data but we are not using that because we don’t want to delete local data either.

 
## 3. Reboot and Reinstall WhatsApp


This is an old and simple trick but often works in situations like these. Reboot your smartphone or the computer that you are using and open WhatsApp again. Don’t forget to save all open work before doing so to avoid data loss.
If that doesn’t work, uninstall WhatsApp from your computer or mobile and then reinstall it using the link shared in heading one above. You will have to sign back into WhatsApp and restore data from the backup.

 
## 4. Try All-in-One Messaging Apps


WhatsApp is just one of the many apps that we use on a daily basis. Then there is Telegram, Signal, Slack, etc. And then there are many other apps like Gmail, Trello, and more. All-in-One apps like Station, Ferdi, RamBox, and others allow you to add all these apps in one easy-to-use UI. You can now switch between different apps on the fly and they do a pretty good job of updating all these apps in the background too. I use Ferdi on my MacBook and Station on my Windows laptop. And I have never seen the ‘This version of WhatsApp has expired’ message since then.

 
## WhatsApp Alternatives


Have you tried some of the WhatsApp alternatives yet? There is Telegram which sports way too many features and then there is Signal which is recommended by the likes of Edward Snowden and Elon Musk for privacy and security. Take it for a spin and you may never use WhatsApp again. Who knows!
By the way, do you know what exactly happens when you report and block someone on WhatsApp or report and exit a WhatsApp group? Know everything to be safe and protect yourself.

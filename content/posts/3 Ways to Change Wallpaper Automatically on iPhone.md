Revamp Your iPhone With These 3 Revolutionary Wallpaper Hacks!

Are you tired of seeing the same old wallpaper every time you unlock your iPhone? Do you want to give your phone a fresh and unique look? Well, you have come to the right place! With these three revolutionary wallpaper hacks, you can revamp your iPhone and make it stand out.

Hack #1: Create a Personalized Wallpaper

Why settle for someone else's wallpaper when you can create your own? With the help of any photo editing app like Canva or Adobe Spark, you can design a wallpaper that represents your personality and interests. Add your favorite quotes, photos, or illustrations to create a one-of-a-kind wallpaper. Once you are happy with your design, save it and set it as your wallpaper.

Hack #2: Use Live Wallpapers

If you want to add some motion to your wallpaper, you can use Live Photos or Live Wallpapers on your iPhone. Live Photos lets you capture a few seconds of video along with a photo, which you can set as your wallpaper. Live Wallpapers, on the other hand, are pre-recorded animations that move when you touch your screen. You can download Live Wallpapers from the App Store or make your own using any GIF or video.

Hack #3: Make Use of Widgets

Widgets are small applications that let you access information or perform tasks right from your home screen. With the latest iOS 14 update, you can customize your home screen and add widgets in different sizes and styles. You can add widgets for weather, news, reminders, or any other app that offers widget support. You can even create a personalized widget using shortcuts to your frequently used apps or tasks.

In conclusion, a wallpaper is not just a background on your iPhone, but it is an extension of your personality. So, give your phone a personal touch and try out these revolutionary wallpaper hacks. Experiment, play around, and have fun until you find the perfect wallpaper that makes your phone stand out.

## 1. Using Photo Shuffle Feature (iOS 16)


iOS 16 introduced a new wallpaper feature known as Photo shuffle that helps in changing the lock screen and home screen wallpaper automatically on iPhone. 
Follow these steps to set up photo shuffle on iPhone:
1. Open the notification panel on your iPhone. 
2. Touch and hold any empty space on your screen. 
3. Tap on the (+) Add button at the bottom. Select Photo Shuffle.
4. Now, select the photos that you want to use as your wallpaper and hit the Add button at the top.
5. On the wallpaper edit screen, you can customize the wallpaper using the following tips:

 
Tap on the icon at the bottom-left corner to add or remove wallpapers. Tap on the three-dot icon at the bottom-right side to select the shuffle frequency. You can make your iPhone change wallpaper daily, hourly, when you unlock, or on tap. Swipe left to apply a filter to the wallpaper.


6. Once you have edited the wallpapers, tap on the Add button at the top. If you want to change both the lock screen and home screen wallpaper automatically, tap on Set as wallpaper pair. Alternatively, tap on Customize home screen to choose a different wallpaper for your iPhone’s home screen. 
Now, your iPhone’s wallpaper will change automatically based on the shuffle frequency set. 

 
##  2. Using Focus Modes (iOS 16)


Another way to change the lock screen wallpaper of your iPhone automatically is to link a focus mode to the lock screen. Whenever the focus mode is activated, its associated lock screen will be enabled as well. You can schedule the focus modes as per your needs. 
Follow these steps to link a focus to the lock screen wallpaper:
1. Open Settings on your iPhone. 
2. Go to Focus and select any focus profile. You can even create a new focus profile by tapping on the (+) Add icon at the top. 
3. Inside a focus, go to the Customize screens section. Tap on Choose under the lock screen preview. Now, either choose from the existing lock screen wallpapers or create a new lock screen wallpaper by tapping on the Gallery button. 
4. Select the desired wallpaper and customize the lock screen as per your need. Tap on the Add button to link it to the focus profile.
Pro Tip: You can link a focus to a lock screen wallpaper from the lock screen as well. Touch and hold the lock screen. Tap on the Focus button at the bottom to select a focus. 

 
## 3. Using Shortcut Automation


If the above two methods do not work, you can use Shortcuts. In this method, you need to take the help of the Apple Shortcuts app to change the wallpaper automatically and then assign a trigger to run the shortcut. There are plenty of ways to trigger the shortcut. For instance, the time of day, sunrise, sunset, when you arrive home, when you leave work, etc.
The entire process is broken down into three main steps:
Let’s check the steps in detail. 

 
### Step 1: Organize Your Wallpapers in an Album


The first thing that we need to do is download all the wallpapers that we need to set on the iPhone. If you have your own set of wallpapers then get the wallpapers from there, otherwise, you can check out this list of places that have amazing wallpapers for iPhone/iPad.
Once you have the wallpapers saved in the Photos app, we need to put those wallpapers in a separate album so that it would be easier for the shortcut to find the wallpapers later on. Follow these steps:
1. To put the wallpapers in an album, open the Photos app and tap on the Select button at the top. Select the wallpapers to add to an album. 
2. Tap the Share button and select Add to Album from the share sheet.
3. Create a new album by tapping the New Album button. Give it a name, and tap Save. Remember the name of the album because we’re going to need it later.

 
### Step 2: Create Shortcut to Change iPhone Wallpapers Automatically


Now, we’re going to create a Siri Shortcut that would fetch a random wallpaper from the album we just created and set it as wallpaper on the iPhone’s lock screen.
1. Install and open the Apple Shortcuts app on your iPhone.
2. Tap on the + button at the top right to create a new shortcut. Then, tap the Add Action button to start building the shortcut.
3. Search for the Find Photos action in the menu and tap on it to add it. Then, tap the Add Filter button. This would allow us to add the wallpaper album so that the shortcut only uses those images.
4. Tap the empty space next to Album is label. It would reveal a list of albums that you can select. Tap the name of the wallpaper album we created before.
5. I like to randomize the wallpapers which would keep the order organic and won’t feel predictable. Therefore, tap the variable next to Sort by and select Random from the list. It will be at the bottom of the list.
6. As the shortcut can only set one wallpaper, enable the toggle next to Limit and set it to 1 using the – icon. 
7. Now, you need to add another action. Use the search bar at the bottom to find the Set Wallpaper action. Tap on it. 
8. You can either set the wallpaper on the Lock Screen, Home Screen, or both on iPhone. However, you can not set different wallpapers on the Lock Screen and the Home Screen. I only want to change the Lock Screen wallpaper so I chose that by tapping on the Lock screen and Home screen text.
9. Tap on the arrow in the Wallpaper card. Disable the toggle next to Show Preview as it would allow the Shortcut to run without user input.
10. Give your Shortcut a name and tap Done. Our Shortcut is almost ready for action.

### Step 3: Create Automation for Shortcut


Finally, we just need to set up an automation that would trigger this shortcut automatically.
1. Open the Shortcuts app and tap the Automation tab at the bottom. Then tap the + button at the top-right to create a new automation.
2. Tap Create Personal Automation.
3. Select a trigger at which you want to change the iPhone wallpaper automatically. I went with Time of Day as I can set it to run every morning just before I wake up. That way I’d be greeted with fresh wallpaper every day. You can select any other trigger. Then, adjust the time when you wish the automation to trigger and tap Next.
4. Now, tap the Add Action button. Then, search for Run Shortcut and add it by tapping on it.
5. Then, tap the Shortcut label next to the Run label to open a list of Shortcuts on your iPhone. Find and select the shortcut we created earlier and tap Next in the top right corner.
6. Turn the toggle off that says Ask Before Running and confirm on the pop-up that shows up. This would allow your shortcut to run without any user input. Hit the Done button at the top. 
That’s it, your iPhone would now automatically change the wallpaper whenever the automation triggers the shortcut.

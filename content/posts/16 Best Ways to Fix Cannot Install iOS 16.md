## 1. Check Compatibility


Every year Apple drops support for older iPhones. Devices older than iPhone 8 are the victims of iOS 16. So if you have an older iPhone, you will not get iOS 16. Here’s the list of iPhones on which you can install iOS 16:

 
iPhone 14 / 14 Plus / 14 Pro / 14 Pro MaxiPhone 13 / 13 mini / 13 Pro / 13 Pro MaxiPhone SE (2nd generation, 3rd generation)iPhone 12 / 12 mini / 12 Pro / 12 Pro MaxiPhone 11 / 11 Pro / 11 Pro MaxiPhone XS / XS MaxiPhone XRiPhone XiPhone 8 / 8 Plus
 
## 2. Look at the Right Place


Apple is allowing users to stay on the iOS 15 update. Therefore, you might see the latest version of iOS 15 instead of iOS 16 on your screen while downloading the new update. You may wonder, “Why am I not getting iOS 16?”. The thing is that you must look just below the iOS 15 section under Settings > General > Software update and you will find the Upgrade to iOS 16 button.

 
## 3. Restart Phone


If your iPhone supports iOS 16 and yet you are unable to install it, simply restart the phone once. Often, the error messages will go away when you restart the phone.
To restart your iPhone, long press the Power button until you see the Power off slider. Drag the slider to the right to turn off your iPhone. Then, turn on the iPhone again using the Power button.

 
## 4. Put Device in Airplane Mode


If restarting the iPhone seems like a big task, you can try putting the device in Airplane mode. Doing so will turn off most of the network connections on your phone, thus fixing any temporary network issue that could be causing problems while installing iOS 16.
To enable Airplane mode on your iPhone, open Settings and enable the toggle next to Airplane mode. Wait for a mite. Then, turn off the Airplane mode by disabling the same toggle.

 
## 5. Charge Your iPhone


Your iPhone should have at least 50% battery in order to install iOS 16. Therefore, if your iPhone is low on battery power (less than 50%), you must charge it first and then try installing the update.

 
## 6. Check Wi-Fi


If you get an error like “Unable to verify update” or something similar while installing iOS 16, you should check the Wi-Fi connection. This error mostly occurs due to an issue with the internet connection.
To fix it, you can try the following tips:

 
Restart your Wi-Fi modem.Try installing iOS 16 using a different Wi-Fi connection, if available.Turn off Wi-Fi and install the update using mobile data.
 
## 7. Check Date and Time


Sometimes, a mismatch in the date and time on your iPhone and the Apple servers can also cause problems while installing iOS 16. To fix it, go to Settings > General > Date and time. Enable the toggle next to Set automatically.  


 
## 8. Free up Storage


Your iPhone must have at least 1-2GB of free space in order the download the latest version of iOS without any issue. You must check the storage on your iPhone by going to Settings > General > iPhone storage. If the storage is full, know how to free up storage on iPhone.


 
## 9. Turn off Hotspot


If you are using a hotspot to install iOS 16, I would advise you to turn it off and instead use a regular Wi-Fi connection to download iOS 16.

 
## 10. Turn off VPN


Furthermore, you should also disable any VPN service that is active on your iPhone while installing iOS 16. It can be a third-party VPN app or native service that can be deactivated by going to Settings > General > VPN.

 
## 11. Turn off Low Power Mode


The Low power mode is a feature that helps in saving battery power by turning off some functions of your iPhone. Low power mode can also be responsible for iOS 16 not installing issues. To fix it, you simply have to turn off the Low power mode. For that, go to Settings > Battery. Turn off the toggle for Low power mode.
Tip: When Low power mode is enabled, the battery icon in the status bar will turn yellow. 

 
## 12. Remove SIM Card


Over the years, one odd thing that seems to fix the issue of iOS updates not installing is to re-insert the SIM card. Basically, first, remove the SIM card from your iPhone and then put it back.

 
## 13. Turn off Content and Privacy Restrictions


Some users suggest that turning off Content and privacy restrictions helped them in fixing the iOS 16 not installing issue.
Go to Settings > Screen Time > Content & privacy restrictions. Turn off the toggle next to Content & privacy restrictions.


 
## 14. Redownload Software Update


Often, iOS update doesn’t download properly and that’s why you cannot install it on your iPhone. To fix this issue, simply delete the current download and redownload the software update.
Go to Settings > General > iPhone storage. Tap on iOS X, where X is the version number. Press the Delete update button.
Restart your iPhone after deleting the update. Then, download and install the update again from Settings > General > Software update. Hopefully, you will now be able to install iOS 16 on your iPhone.

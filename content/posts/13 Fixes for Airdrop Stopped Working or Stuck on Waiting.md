# Shocking Discovery: Your Airdrop May Be BROKEN! But fear not, we’ve found 13 Simple Fixes to Get it Back on Track!

Are you having trouble with your Airdrop? Does it fail to send or receive files? Are you constantly receiving “Your Airdrop is Not Working” or “Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are not on” messages? Don’t worry! You are not alone. Many users report issues with the popular wireless file transfer method developed by Apple. While Airdrop is designed to work seamlessly and effortlessly, sometimes it can go wrong. But don’t panic! In this article, we’ve gathered 13 simple fixes to help you get your Airdrop back on track without breaking a sweat.

### What is Airdrop?

First things first, let's talk about Airdrop. Airdrop is an Apple feature that allows you to wirelessly transfer files and content between compatible Apple devices. It uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to create a peer-to-peer ad-hoc network and enables easy file sharing without the need for cables or internet connections. Airdrop is available on all Apple devices running iOS 7 or later or  OS X Lion (10.7) or later. The feature is easy to use, quick, and secure. However, many users face Airdrop-related problems, and it can become annoying if not fixed.

### What are the common Airdrop issues?

Airdrop problems are not uncommon. People often report that their Airdrop is not sending or receiving files, failing to detect devices, or giving error messages like “Airdrop not working.”  Some of the most common issues are:

1. Airdrop is not recognizing your device.
2. Airdrop is failing to send or receive files.
3. Airdrop is working only partially or intermittently.
4. Airdrop is not working between different devices, e.g., iPhone to Mac.

### 13 Simple Fixes to Get Your Airdrop Back on Track

If you are facing issues with Airdrop, try these quick and easy fixes:

1. Ensure that your Airdrop is turned on and is discoverable. Swipe down the Control Center, and long-press the Airdrop icon to check.
2. Make sure that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are turned on.
3. Check that both the sending and receiving devices support Airdrop. If Airdrop is not working between iPhone and Mac, make sure that both devices are compatible.
4. Ensure that the devices are within range of each other. Airdrop works only when the two devices are near.
5. Restart your device. This works wonders as it can help kill any background process causing trouble.
6. Turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and turn them back on. This will refresh the wireless connection.
7. Disable Personal Hotspot if it is turned on. Airdrop can get confused if both features are on simultaneously.
8. Put both devices into Airplane mode and then turn off Airplane mode.
9. Sign out of iCloud and sign back in. This can help reset your device's network settings.
10. Update your firmware to the latest version. Apple frequently releases updates that can fix Airdrop-related issues.
11. Reset your network settings. This will erase your saved Wi-Fi passwords, so be prepared to re-enter them.
12. Perform a hard reset by holding down the Home and Lock buttons simultaneously until the device shuts down and restarts.
13. If nothing else works, contact Apple Support.

### Conclusion

Airdrop is an excellent feature that makes file transfer and sharing across Apple devices simple and efficient. However, it is not immune to glitches and hiccups. If your Airdrop is not working properly, don't fret. Try these simple fixes before calling for professional help. With a little patience and a few clicks, you can get your Airdrop up and running without breaking a sweat. Happy sharing!

Note: If you are having trouble with AirDrop on your iPad, you can follow the steps mentioned for your iPhone and apply them on your iPad as well.

 
## 1. Unlock Your Devices


In many instances, when you are AirDropping to an iPhone, it isn’t visible on the list. Check whether the iPhone is unlocked or not. Apple doesn’t allow you to AirDrop on a locked iPhone, hence it might not show up on the list. Just like the iPhone, you also need to keep your Mac unlocked in order to use the AirDrop. Unlocking your Mac is an effortless process, enter the password or touch the Touch ID in order to unlock your Mac. Once your Mac is unlocked, try using AirDrop, it should work just fine.

 
## 2. Keep Devices Closer


Apple asks users to keep the devices in closer proximity in order to send and receive files successfully using AirDrop. The maximum distance should be 30 feet (9 meters) between the devices (iPhone,iPad, and Mac) you use for AirDrop. So if you are exceeding this limit, there’s a chance that either you won’t be able to successfully AirDrop to another device or if there’s an ongoing transfer, it will get canceled.

 
## 3. Restart Your iPhone and Mac


Sometimes a quick reboot or restart can fix common issues like AirDrop getting stuck on waiting on your iPhone and Mac.

## Discord on Chromebook


Discord web app has a lot of pros but it doesn’t work in the background, so features like notifications and push to talk don’t work reliably. Android app works like charm, but the UI is not optimized for the desktop layout. Discord’s Linux app is a full-fledged desktop app, but you still miss out on some features because of the Linux container. So choose the version that suits your needs.

3. Tap on the (+) icon at the bottom of the Markup editor and select the Square box from the menu.
4. Tap on the Square/circle shape icon at the bottom and choose the filled-in square present on the left side.
5. Drag the box over the area that you want to hide. Also, you can adjust the size of the box using the blue circles.

7. Finally, tap on Done at the top right corner followed by Done again on the screen that shows up to save the edited image. Please note that the edited image will replace the original image after saving.

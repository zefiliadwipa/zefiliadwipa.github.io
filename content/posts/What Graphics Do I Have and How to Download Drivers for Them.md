Are You Gaming with Inferior Graphics? Discover Your Graphics Card Now and Speed Up Your System with Easy Driver Downloads!

As a gamer, there's nothing more frustrating than playing your favorite game at a choppy, slow frame rate, or seeing graphics that look like they were produced a decade ago. That's why investing in a quality graphics card is essential for any serious gamer.

A graphics card, also known as a video card, is responsible for handling the rendering of visual data in a computer. It helps to display good-looking graphics and produce playable frame rates. A good graphics card makes a huge difference when it comes to boosting your gaming performance and visuals.

One important aspect of maintaining a quality graphics card is regularly updating its drivers. Drivers are essential software components that help your graphics card communicate with your computer's operating system. You need to update your drivers regularly to ensure optimal performance and stability.

So, how do you know if you have an inferior graphics card or an outdated driver? Here's how to find out:

Step 1: Identify Your Graphics Card

To identify your graphics card, follow these steps:

1. Type "dxdiag" in the search box and press Enter.

2. Click on the "Display" tab.

3. Here you'll see your graphics card name and type.

Step 2: Check Your Graphics Card Performance

If you suspect that your graphics card is not performing well, you can use benchmarking software like 3DMark to test the performance of your graphics card. 3DMark will also give you a score that you can compare to the average score for your graphics card model.

Step 3: Download the Latest Graphics Driver

Once you've identified your graphics card, head to the manufacturer's website, and download the latest drivers for your graphics card. For example, if you have an NVIDIA graphics card, go to the NVIDIA website and download the latest driver for your card.

Updating your drivers is a simple process. Most manufacturers offer driver update tools that automatically detect and download the latest drivers for your graphics card. Alternatively, you can manually download and install the latest driver.

In conclusion, having a quality graphics card and regularly updating its drivers are crucial for a great gaming experience. So, take the time to identify your graphics card, check its performance, and update its drivers regularly. Doing so will ensure you're gaming with great graphics and optimal performance.

## Which GPU Do You Have Installed


First, figure out who is the manufacturer of the GPU your system uses. There are three primary or popular manufacturers of GPUs in the market presently: Intel, NVIDIA, and AMD. To find which GPU you have, follow the steps below.
1. Click on Windows button, then click on the Search Menu and type Task Manager. Click on that to open the Task Manager window.
2. Once Task Manager opens, click on the Performance section and go to GPU which will usually be the last option. You will now see the name of the GPU company and model. If you don’t have GPU drivers installed, it will instead show Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.
For Windows 10 users, the Taskbar will look slightly different. Click on Performance tab (2nd tab from left) and then click on GPU 0/GPU 1 to find out what graphics card you have installed on your system.
3. Depending on your device, you might have several GPUs listed as GPU0 and GPU1. In our case, we have NVIDIA GeForce 1650 Ti and AMD Radeon Integrated Graphics.
If you do have multiple GPUs on Windows 10/11, learn how to set the default GPU for different apps (preferably you want to use low-power integrated graphics for most scenarios and set dedicated graphics for games, professional software, etc.)

 
## Find and Download Right Graphics Card Drivers


Once you have identified which graphics card your system is running, now it is time to download and install the correct drivers for it. 
1. Open your favorite browser using the Start menu or Taskbar pinned icon.
2. We will be explaining exactly how to download the driver on the website for all three vendors, so follow the steps below depending on what GPU Vendor you use. 
Note: Continue reading from Step 3 for NVIDIA GPUs. Skip to Step 5 for AMD GPUs, and to Step 8 for Intel GPUs.
3. Visit the official NVIDIA GPU Drivers webpage to select and download drivers.
Here, you have to select the Product Type by using the drop-down menu next to it to find your GPU’s type (Note that NVIDIA RTX and Quadro are different from NVIDIA GeForce RTX/GTX GPUs). Usually, this is GeForce.
Next, click on the drop-down menu for Product Series, and select which generation your GPU is from. This corresponds with your GPU’s model. In our case, we have a GTX 1650 Ti on a laptop, hence the correct product series is GeForce GTX 16 Series (Notebooks).
After this, click on the drop-down menu for Product, and select your GPU model.
Move on to clicking on the drop-down menu for Operating System, and select either Windows 10 (x32/x64) or Windows 11 based on what you have. Lastly, click on the drop-down menu for Download Type and select Studio Driver (SD) for professional use cases, or Game Ready Driver (GRD) for gaming-focused use. Although, there is no issue with using GRD for many professional uses such as editing software.
Once you have selected all parameters, click on Search.
4. You will be taken to a new webpage. Click on Download button to start downloading the GPU drivers from NVIDIA.
5. For AMD Radeon GPUs, go to AMD Drivers and Support page.
You will see several drop-down menus. First, click on either Graphics or Processor with graphics depending on which GPU model you are downloading the driver for.
If you can’t find your GPU listed, search for it under other categories. On the next drop-down menu, select the graphics card generation/series you own. 
After this, in the next menu select the correct GPU model series you own. Then, in the next section, you will find the graphics card models in accordance with the model series you just selected. Lastly, click on the GPU model which you own, in the last drop-down menu. Once done, click on Submit button.
6. On the next page, click on the Operating System that you use. In our case, it is Windows 11.
7. Finally, click on Download button next to the compatible drivers, but make sure to use the WHQL Certified driver.
8. This step is for Intel graphics cards users. Go to the Intel Drivers and Support website. Click on Search Intel Products and type your GPU model (that we noted down back in the previous section through Task Manager). 
In our case, we will search for an integrated graphics driver that is used by the Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor, also known as Intel XE Integrated Graphics.
You can see that after searching for i5-1135G7, the search menu displays options — select the right one and it will take you to that product’s drivers and support page.

9. After clicking on your relevant Intel product in the last step, you will now be seeing a couple of drivers available to download. Do read the relevant descriptions underneath the drivers and check if it seems to support your generation of Intel processor, or if it mentions your Intel integrated/dedicated graphics model name such as Intel Arc, Intel XE, and Intel UHD. Now, click on the driver that is the most relevant to your system’s GPU model. 
10. To recheck you have selected the right details, don’t download the driver but instead, scroll down below to Detailed Description.
Now, under the driver’s description, there will be a list of processors and their relative integrated graphics card model names. If you are downloading for a dedicated GPU, this will seem different, and mention support for different Arc GPU models.
Check if your processor’s model and integrated graphics model’s name are mentioned. If you’re using dedicated, make sure it has the support for your specific Intel Arc GPU.
11. When satisfied, scroll back up to the top, and click on the Download button.

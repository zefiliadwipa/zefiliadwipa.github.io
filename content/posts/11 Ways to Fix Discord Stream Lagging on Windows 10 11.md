Genius Hacks To Banish Discord Stream Lagging On Windows 10 (Number 5 Will Blow Your Mind!)

Online gaming has never been as exciting as it is today. The ability to communicate with other players in real-time makes the gaming experience even more thrilling. With Discord, an online chat application, gamers can communicate with other players during the game. However, lagging and buffering issues can interrupt your gameplay and chat experience. It can be frustrating when your screen delays or freezes when you are in the middle of an intense game. 

Discord lagging on Windows 10 is a widespread problem that many gamers experience. But, there is no need to worry because there are several hacks you can employ to banish the lagging and buffering problems once and for all. This article will provide an in-depth look at five genius hacks to eliminate Discord stream lagging on Windows 10.

1. Check Your Internet Connection

The first and most critical step to resolving the issue is ensuring your internet connection is stable. A slow or unstable internet connection can cause lagging, buffering, and other problems. Check your internet connections speed using online speed testers such as speedtest.net, fast.com, or Google Speed Test. 

If your internet speed is well below average, consider upgrading your internet plan or switching to a better internet provider. Additionally, close any unnecessary applications and background programs that may consume bandwidth and interfere with your gaming experience.

2. Update Your Discord App

Outdated software may cause compatibility problems, bugs, or security risks that can result in lagging and buffering. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that your Discord app is up to date.

To update your Discord app on Windows 10:

- Open the Discord app 
- Navigate to user settings' cogwheel icon at the bottom left of the screen
- Go to 'App Settings' 
- Scroll to the 'Advanced' section 
- Hit the 'Update' button to update the app.

3. Disable Hardware Acceleration

Hardware acceleration is the process of offloading computing tasks from your computer's CPU to your graphics card. It improves your computer's performance, but it sometimes causes issues with Discord. Therefore, disabling hardware acceleration may solve lagging and buffering issues.

To disable hardware acceleration on Windows 10:

- Open the Discord app 
- Navigate to user settings' cogwheel icon at the bottom left of the screen
- Go to 'Appearance' 
- Scroll down and toggle off the 'Hardware Acceleration' button. 

4. Manage Discord's Audio Subsystem

Audio subsystem issues can cause lagging and buffering problems in Discord. Discord has two audio subsystem options: Standard and Legacy. The Standard subsystem is the default option, but it can cause issues with some Windows 10 computers.

Changing to the Legacy Audio subsystem can assist chat lagging and buffering problems. This will help to ensure that your voice chats are clear, and the voice commands are executed promptly.

To switch to the Legacy Audio subsystem:

- Open the Discord app 
- Navigate to user settings' cogwheel icon at the bottom left of the screen
- Go to 'Voice & Video' 
- Scroll to the 'Audio Subsystem' section 
- From the dropdown menu, select 'Legacy.' 

5. Optimize Windows 10 for Gaming

The ultimate fix for your Discord stream lagging may be settings up your Windows 10 machine to optimize gaming performance. You can do this through a variety of methods:

- Power Setting: Make sure your computer is in High-Performance mode to prioritize performance over conservation.
- Graphics driver: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of your graphics driver to avoid compatibility issues that cause lagging.
- Disable Xbox DVR: Xbox Game DVR, a feature that records gameplay footage and takes snapshots, often affects game performance. 
- Disable unnecessary background applications: Close all background apps and programs to free up RAM, CPU, GPU, and network bandwidth for the game.

Discord stream lagging can cause inconvenience in your gaming experience. However, the above tips and tricks can eliminate streaming lag and buffering on Windows 10. Start by checking your internet connection speeds and update your Discord app. Then disable hardware acceleration and manage Discord's audio subsystem. Lastly, optimize Windows 10 for gaming. With these hacks, you can play online games on Discord without any interruptions or lagging.

Let’s begin.

 
## Before We Begin


Some users say that viewers aren’t able to stream Discord screen even though the internet is working fine. The Internet is not the only reason why your Discord stream is lagging or stuttering. Here is a short checklist before you try other troubleshooting methods.

 
If you have already checked the internet connection, move on. Otherwise, check Fast.com to check your internet speed, check if you have enough data left, or talk to your ISP if you feel something is off.Using a VPN or proxy will reduce loading and streaming speed significantly. Try disabling them if using them.Finally, update the Discord app.Try updating Discord to the latest version. If you have downloaded it from Microsoft Store, you can update it from Library > Get updates. If you downloaded the setup file directly from Discord, repeat the same process and simply reinstall.
 
## 1. Close Apps


Close other apps that might be competing for bandwidth like torrents, streaming apps like Netflix, active browser downloads, etc. Maybe even browsers if you are not using them actively. If you have too many tabs and windows open, close the ones that you don’t need anymore.

 
## 2. Enable/Disable Hardware Acceleration


Hardware acceleration lets Discord use the dedicated GPU that is installed on your computer to render images and videos. If it is disabled, try enabling it to check if it helps. If it is enabled, try disabling it to see if that fixes Discord screen lags as sometimes it interferes with Discord streaming process.
1. Click on the cog icon on the bottom side of the left sidebar to open Settings.
2. Under Advanced section in the left sidebar, you will find Hardware Acceleration. Toggle it off if it is enabled and see if that helps with Discord streaming. Toggle it on if it is disabled and check if Discord streaming is still lagging.

 
## 3. Enable Video Codec


Discord is an advanced but complicated app. It has many layers and you can do many things with it. One of them is audio and video call while the other is live streaming to share your skills. You need to enable video codecs or disable video codecs to make sure your viewers don’t experience lags while streaming on Discord.
1. Click on the cog icon to open Settings again. You will find it in the left sidebar.
2. Go to Voice & Video section in the left sidebar. Now scroll a little and enable both Video Code options. One is H.264 Hardware Acceleration and the other is OpenH264 Video Codec.

 
## 4. Disable QoS Packet


Some users were able to fix Discord streaming issues by disabling the Quality of Service feature. Might work for you too.
1. Go back to Discord settings via the cog icon.
2. Under the Voice & Video section in the left sidebar, disable Quality of Packet High Packet Priority option.

 
## 5. Turn Off Overlay in Discord


When you are playing a game on your Windows computer, you might see some Discord elements and icons making it easy for you to communicate. These are called overlay. While good to have, they can also result in streaming lags on the Discord app. Disabling them can help improve performance.
1. Open Discord settings by clicking on the cog icon in the sidebar.
2. Under Game Overlay section in the left sidebar, disable the toggle next to Enable in-game overlay option.

 
## 6. Clear Discord Cache


Cache and other temporary files can get accumulated over time leading to weird issues like the one you are facing where Discord streams are lagging. Clearing cache data is quick and can help. You will have to sign back into Discord though.
1. Press Windows+R to open the Run prompt. Type the command below and press Enter to execute it.
2. That command would open a folder where all the cache files pertaining to Discord app are saved. Press Ctrl+A to select them all and then press Del to delete them.

 
## 7. Windows Troubleshooter


Windows has a troubleshooter built-in for a number of common errors and one of them is for the network. It will look for network-related errors and find ways to improve your internet speed and connection.
1. Press Windows + I to open Windows Settings. Search for Find and fix network problems using the search bar in the upper left corner and select to open it.
2. In the pop-up that follows, click on the Next button and then follow on-screen instructions after that.

 
## 8. Disable Vsync


If you are using a 144hz display or higher, try disabling vsync feature from the Nvidia or AMDA control panel. Also reduce FPS to 60. That has helped Discord stream lags for several users.

 
## 9. Update Graphics Card Drivers


Discord screen share streaming uses graphics card, whether dedicated or integrated, to render images and videos. Updating their drivers could help fix Discord stream lags and improve video quality.
1. Press the Windows button and search for Device Manager and open it.
2. Click to expand Display adapters and then right-click on the graphics card you have installed to select Update driver.
Intel is usually integrated graphics and less powerful while Nvidia or AMDA offers dedicated gaming cards and are much more powerful.

 
## 10. Reset Discord Voice Settings


If you feel the voice is breaking while the video is streaming alright, maybe it is not Discord streaming process that is lagging after all? To check:
1. Click on the cog icon in the left sidebar to open Discord Settings.
2. Select Voice & Video in the left sidebar and then scroll to the bottom of the page to find Reset Voice Settings.
3. Click on OK to confirm if you see the dialogue box.

 
## 11. Nitro Plan


Although this is not exactly a troubleshooting option, it still helps. Nitro users get additional feature access and one of them is the ability to choose higher stream rates and HD video streaming. You can stream 4K and up to 60fps. Nitro will cost you $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year. A worthy upgrade to fix Discord stream lagging on Windows 10/11 computers.

# You Won't Believe What Blocking Someone on LinkedIn Does! Find Out Now!

LinkedIn is one of the most popular social networking sites out there, especially for people looking for employment opportunities. It is a great platform for professionals to connect with one another, build their professional network, and ultimately find job opportunities.

However, as with any social media platform, LinkedIn isn't free from negative interactions. One such interaction is the need to block someone on LinkedIn. Most people block others on LinkedIn if they don't want to be reached, or if they receive spam messages or unwanted solicitation.

But, have you ever wondered what happens when you block someone on LinkedIn? In this article, we will explore the different outcomes of blocking someone on LinkedIn.

### What Happens When You Block Someone on LinkedIn?

When you block someone on LinkedIn, several actions follow. First, the person you've blocked will not be able to view your profile, send you direct messages, or invite you to connect. Additionally, any endorsements or recommendations they have given you will be removed from your profile.

Moreover, if you share connections with the person you have blocked, they won't be able to see your updates, posts, or comments. However, they might still see your public comments and updates in groups where you both belong.

### How Do You Block Someone on LinkedIn?

Blocking someone on LinkedIn is not difficult. To block someone, follow these simple steps:

1. Go to the person's profile you want to block.
2. Click on the More option located under the person's profile picture.
3. Select Report/Block option and click on Block [Name].
4. LinkedIn will ask you to confirm the blocking action. Click Block again to confirm.

After following these steps, the person you have blocked will be removed from your connections list, the recommendations they have given you will be hidden, and all their endorsements will be removed from your profile.

### Can You Unblock Someone on LinkedIn?

Yes, you can unblock someone on LinkedIn if you change your mind. To unblock someone, follow the steps below:

1. Go to your LinkedIn homepage and click on the "Me" icon located in the top right corner.
2. Click on the "Settings & Privacy" option.
3. Under the "Account" tab, click on the "Blocking and hiding" option.
4. You will see a list of profiles you have blocked. Click on the "Unblock" option next to the person's name.

Once you unblock someone on LinkedIn, they will not be notified. However, they will be able to view your profile, but you will need to send them a connection request if you want to connect again.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, LinkedIn is a powerful tool, but sometimes blocking someone is necessary. Not only does blocking someone prevent them from seeing your profile, but it also stops them from sending you direct messages or invitations. Moreover, blocking someone removes their endorsements from your profile.

So, if someone on LinkedIn is bothering you, spamming you, or sending you unwanted messages, you know what to do. Block them, and enjoy a peaceful LinkedIn experience.

## What Happens When You Block/Unblock Someone on LinkedIn


Actually, many things happen and don’t happen when you block and unblock someone on LinkedIn. Let’s go through them quickly.

 
### What Happens When You Block Someone on LinkedIn
 
 The person you have blocked on LinkedIn won’t receive any notification when you block him/her. The same is also true when you unblock them. But if the profile being blocked is someone with whom you have shared a recruiter account with, then LinkedIn may notify the person of the block. You will have to wait up to 48 hours before you can reblock the same member twice. Your LinkedIn profile timeline won’t show recommendations from the blocked profile. You won’t see these recommendations even after you unblock them.  Profiles that you have blocked will be visible under Settings > Visibility > Blocking under your profile. Neither of you can access and view the other’s profile on LinkedIn. Neither of you can send messages to the other on LinkedIn. Shared content by one profile won’t be visible to the other. You will no longer be connected to each other. You won’t see his/her profile under Who’s Viewed Your Profile; the same is true for the blocked profile. You won’t receive notifications for any upcoming LinkedIn events of the blocked account. The blocked profile will no longer receive your newsletter even if subscribed. Recommendations and endorsements from the blocked profile will be removed from your profile too. You can’t join an audio event if you have blocked the host or any of the speakers. 
 
### What Happens When You Unblock Someone on LinkedIn
 
 You have to reconnect with them on LinkedIn. Once they accept, you can view and interact with their profile as usual. Once you have reconnected, you can follow them (again) if you want to.  
 
### Exceptions and Points to Keep in Mind


Now there are some exceptions and situations where a blocked person may still be able to see you or access information sent out by you. Let us see what they are and the conditions required to fulfill them:

 
 A blocked person may still see your profile if it is public.  A blocked profile may also see your content posted in open public group discussions, publicly shared content, and comments on Top Voices posts. You can control how you appear in searches from your Public Profile Settings. You may see content in your news feed from someone you blocked if that content was shared by a mutual friend/contact. If someone views your profile before you blocked them, they will still be counted in your profile viewer count. However, their profile details won’t be reflected in the Viewer Details. As we noted earlier, blocked people can’t view your profile. If a person is browsing LinkedIn in private mode, you can’t block them at the time of writing this guide. 


1. Why can’t I find the profile that I want to block on LinkedIn?
It is possible that they have blocked you first, that their profile is in hibernation, or has closed his/her account. If the profile was found to be abusive, spreading spam, or breaking other LinkedIn professional and publishing guidelines, it may have been removed from the site.
2. I can’t block the organizer of an event. Why?
Attendees can only block the organizer of an event after they have left the event. Here is how to respond to LinkedIn events. 
3. Why can’t I block the admin of a group?
Because it is not allowed by LinkedIn, you can leave a group but can’t block the admin or managers of the group. However, you can block them once their admin permission has been removed that is they are no longer the admin of the group.
4. I can’t block group members either.
You need to leave the group before you can block a member of that group on LinkedIn. You can contact the admin/manager and ask them to block the member with your reasons.
5. I am an admin/manager of a LinkedIn group then why can’t I block a member of my group?
You will have to remove that person from the group first before you can block their profile.
6. I blocked a profile but still see content shared from their profile on LinkedIn mobile. Why?
This can be due to cache data. While you have blocked their profile, it is not updated in the cache data. To update, sign out and back into your LinkedIn profile on the mobile app.
7. How many profiles can I limit on LinkedIn and is there a limit?
You can block no more than 1400 profiles on LinkedIn.
8. What about contacts stored locally in the Contacts app on my mobile or other devices?
Blocking a contact on LinkedIn won’t prevent the person from contacting you via SMS or calls. You will need to delete the contact manually or block them on your device to stop that. Learn what happens when you block a contact on your smartphone.

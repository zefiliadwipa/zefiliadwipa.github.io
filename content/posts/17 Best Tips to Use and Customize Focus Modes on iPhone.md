Unlock Your iPhone's Hidden Power: Master Focus Modes with These 17 Game-Changing Tips!

As smartphones continue to become more advanced, the cameras on them are also rapidly improving. People are using their phones to take photos and videos more than ever before, and manufacturers are adding more advanced features to keep up with the trend. The iPhone is one of the best examples, with a camera that is capable of producing stunning results. However, for many users, the camera can be overwhelming and complicated, and they may not be using it to its full potential. 

One of the most important aspects of the iPhone's camera that is often overlooked is the focus mode. Understanding the different focus modes available on your iPhone can help you take your photography skills to the next level. Here are 17 tips to help you get started: 

1. Use Auto Focus: This mode is the default setting for the iPhone camera, and it automatically adjusts the focus for you. It is the perfect mode for beginners who are still learning the camera's settings.

2. Tap to Focus: You can manually control the focus of your iPhone's camera by tapping the screen. Simply tap on the area you want to be in focus, and the camera will adjust accordingly.

3. Hold to Lock Focus: When you tap on the screen to focus on a particular subject, you can hold your finger there to lock the focus. This is especially useful if you’re trying to take a shot of a moving subject or if you need to compose your shot without the focus changing.

4. Use AE/AF Lock: This mode is similar to the previous one, but it locks the exposure as well. To activate, tap and hold the screen until a yellow box appears, indicating that the focus and exposure have been locked.

5. Turn on Grid Lines: By turning on grid lines in your iPhone's camera settings, you can use the rule of thirds to improve your composition. This will help you frame your shots more effectively and create a more balanced photo.

6. Enable Focus Peaking: This mode outlines the areas that are in focus with a colored fringe. It's a great tool to help you see what's sharp in your image when you’re taking photos of intricate details.

7. Use Depth Effect: The iPhone's Portrait mode adds a depth effect to your images, creating a blurred background that highlights the subject. This mode works best when the subject is closer to the camera.

8. Use Manual Focus: In the manual focus mode, you can adjust the focus by swiping up or down on the screen. You can use this mode to create a shallow depth of field, achieve a selective focus or create a unique look of selective blur.

9. Set a Custom White Balance: If you're not happy with the way your camera's auto white balance is adjusting your image, then you can set a custom white balance by using a neutral object (such as a white sheet) as a reference point.

10. Adjust Exposure: By adjusting the exposure, you can brighten or darken your image. To do so, tap the area you want to adjust the exposure for and drag the sun icon up to brighten or down to darken.

11. Use Burst Mode: Burst mode is perfect for capturing fast-moving subjects or for taking a series of photos that you can later choose from. To activate, hold down the shutter button or the volume up button.

12. Take a Live Photo: By taking a live photo, you can capture a moment with movement and sound. To activate this feature, tap the Live Photo icon at the top of the camera screen.

13. Use the Timer: If you need more control over your shots, use the timer to set a delay before your camera takes the shot. To activate this feature, tap the Timer icon at the top of the camera screen.

14. Use the Grid to Draw Attention: Grids can be used to draw the viewer's attention to a specific part of the photo or create a more artistic effect. Experiment with different types of grid and see which works best for your shot.

15. Enable Flash: Using the iPhone's flash can be tricky, but it’s worth experimenting with it in different lighting conditions. Try bouncing the light off a white surface to diffuse it or use a diffuser to create softer light.

16. Adjust the Brightness: If you find that the lighting conditions are too challenging, try adjusting the brightness in the camera settings. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up the Control Center and adjust the brightness to suit your needs.

17. Use Filters: Filters are an easy way to add different effects to your photos. Experiment with different filters to see what works best for your image. You can always adjust the intensity of the filter before sharing your photo.

In conclusion, mastering your iPhone's focus mode is a game-changer for budding photographers. By experimenting with the different modes and features, you will be able to take stunning photos and videos that truly showcase your creativity. Remember, the most important thing is to have fun and experiment!

## 1. Change Focus Mode Quickly


Touch and hold the Focus mode icon/label on the Lock screen or in Control Center. All the available modes will show up. Tap on the one that you want to activate. 

 
## 2. Use Siri to Enable or Disable Focus Modes


Focus modes are compatible with Siri, so you can use Siri to toggle them on and off. Say commands like, “Siri turn on Driving focus”, “turn off Gaming focus”, and so forth.

 
## 3. Create Your Own Focus Profile


Apple offers a number of pre-created Focus profiles, such as Do not disturb, Driving, Fitness, Gaming, Meditation, Sleep, Reading, Mindfulness, and Personal. If the conditions set in them do not meet your requirements, you can also create your own Focus profile.
To create your own Focus, go to Settings > Focus. Tap on the add (+) icon at the top and select Custom on the next screen.
Give your Focus a name and choose its color and icon. Hit the Next button. You will be prompted to define the Focus’s conditions, such as allowed contacts, allowed apps, and so on. These conditions can always be changed afterward.

 
## 4. Allow or Silence Notifications From Selected People or Apps 


In iOS 15, you can only allow notifications from selected people and apps by adding them to the white list of each Focus profile separately. But in iOS 16, you can both allow and silence notifications from selected contacts and apps in the notification settings of each Focus.
1. Open the Focus profile for which you want to allow or silence notifications. 
2. Tap on People or Apps under the Allowed (iOS 15)/Notifications (iOS 16) section. In iOS 15, add the contacts or apps from which you want to allow notifications. 
On iOS 16, first, select whether you want to silence or allow notifications. Then, add the desired people to the list. 

 
## 5. Allow Calls From Selected People


In each Focus profile, you can further customize who can call you when a particular Focus is active. This comes in handy if you want to silence notifications but allow incoming calls from selected people.
1. Go to Settings > Focus > [Desired Focus profile].
2. On iOS 16, tap on People and select Allow or Silence notifications. 
3. Then, tap on Allow calls from and choose the desired group.
Similarly, in iOS 15, tap People followed by Calls from.
By default, the Favorites list is selected. You can choose Everyone, No one, All contacts, or Groups.
Tip: You have to create groups in the Contacts app.

 
## 6. Allow Repeated Calls


Each Focus profile offers the feature to allow repeated calls. Basically, when enabled, your iPhone will not silence calls from people who have called you twice in the last three minutes. 
To enable it, go to Settings > Focus > [Desired Focus profile] > People. If anything other than Everyone is selected under Allow calls from, you will see the Allow repeated calls toggle. Turn it on. 
On iOS 15, go to Focus > [Desired Focus profile]> People > Calls from.  Enable the toggle next to Allow repeated calls.

 
## 7. Let People Know You Have Activated a Focus Profile


When any Focus mode is active on your iPhone, Apple notifies others in supported apps like iMessage about the same. They will see the ‘Contact has notifications silenced’ in your chat thread. This is possible by the Focus status feature. It is enabled by default for all the Focus modes but you can enable or disable it manually too. 
On iOS 16, go to Settings > Focus > Focus Status. You can turn it off for all Focus profiles or enable/disable it for individual profiles using the toggle next to each Focus. 
On iOS 15, go to Settings > Focus > [Preferred Focus mode] > Share Focus status. Enable or disable it on the next screen.

 
## 8. Enable Custom Home Screen Pages for a Focus


The Focus modes aren’t just for alerts. Custom home screen pages can be displayed based on the Focus profile selected. Let’s look at a Fitness Focus as an example. When enabled, you can display pages containing large fitness widgets and app icons such as Health, Happy Scale, and so on without any distractions.  
Please keep in mind that you must first create custom pages; otherwise, you will not be able to see them while configuring Focus. You can also leverage the concept of personalized pages on shared devices and allow people to have their own apps or home screen layouts based on a Focus selected. Isn’t it cool?
On iOS 16, go to Settings > Focus > [Preferred Focus mode]. Tap on Choose or Edit under Home screen preview. Then, select the preferred pages that you want to show. 
On iOS 15, open Settings > Focus > [Preferred Focus mode] > Home screen. Enable the toggle for Custom pages. Select the home screen pages to display and tap on Done.
Tip: You can also hide notification badges for a Focus profile in the home screen settings on iOS 15. 

 
## 9. Enable Custom Lock Screen for a Focus


In iOS 16, you can link lock screens to a Focus profile. That means whenever you activate a particular Focus, the linked lock screen will show up and vice versa. Read our guide that explains how to link Focus to the lock screen. 

 
## 10. View Silenced Notifications on the Lock Screen


When a Focus profile is enabled, silenced notifications will not appear on the lock screen by default. You may, however, change this behavior and have notifications show on the lock screen.
In iOS 16, go to Settings > Focus > [Preferred Focus mode]. Tap on Options under Notifications. Enable the toggle for Show on Lock screen. 
Similarly, in iOS 15, go to Settings > Focus > [Preferred Focus mode] > Lock screen. Enable the toggle next to Show on Lock screen.

 
## 11. Share Focus Modes Across Devices


The Focus modes support cross-device functionality, thus saving you the hassle of configuring them on each device separately. So, if you enable Focus mode on one device, it will turn on all other devices tied to your iCloud account. It is compatible with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch.
To enable or disable sharing of Focus modes across devices, go to Settings > Focus. Turn off the toggle for Share across devices.

 
## 12. Schedule Focus Modes


Focus modes can be set to activate automatically based on the criteria you specify. Automation criteria could include a specified time, location, the app opened, or a combination of these. For example, you can set Do not disturb to activate automatically from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. or whenever you access the Kindle app.
To set these conditions, open the required Focus mode and tap on Add schedule or Automation. Tap on Time, Location, or App to set the automation as per your requirements.

 
## 13. Allow iPhone to Activate Focus Modes Automatically


In addition to manually selecting the activation criteria as described above, your device can automatically activate a Focus depending on signals like location, app usage, and more that it learns over time.
To enable this feature, open the preferred Focus mode and go to Add schedule or Automation. Tap on Smart Activation.

 
## 14. Enable a Focus Temporarily


Sure, you can schedule Focus profiles, but did you know you can temporarily enable a Focus like for an hour or until evening? To do so, open Control Center and touch and hold the Focus tile. Press the three-dot icon next to the Focus profile to set a time period for it. 

 
## 15. Add Focus Filters


In iOS 16, you can change how certain apps behave when a particular Focus is active. For instance, you can turn on Low power mode, enable dark mode, open a specific tab group in Safari, and more. 
To add Focus filters, go to Settings > Focus > [Desired Focus profile]. Scroll down and tap on Add filter under Focus filter. Tap on the app or system filter that you want to add and customize it as per your requirement. 

 
## 16. Automate Focus Modes Using Shortcuts App


You may further automate the Focus modes by using the Apple Shortcuts app to create triggers. Open the Shortcuts app and tap on the Automation tab followed by Create personal automation.
Scroll down and you will find all the available Focus modes. Tap on the one that you want to automate and choose Turn on or Turn off trigger. Tap on Next and choose the required action.

 
## 17. Send and Change Auto-Reply Message in Driving Focus


The Driving Focus comes with an auto-reply feature. Within Settings > Focus > Driving > Auto-reply, you can choose who receives auto-reply messages and customize the message text as well.
1. How to know if a Focus Mode is active or not?
When a Focus mode is active, you will see its icon in three places: the Control Center, the lock screen, and the status bar.
2. How to turn off Focus mode on iPhone?
Open Control Center and tap on the Focus tile. Then, tap the currently active focus from the list of Focus modes to disable it. Check out other ways to turn off Focus mode on your iPhone.

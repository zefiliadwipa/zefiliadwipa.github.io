## 1. Access Markup Editor in Different Apps on iPhone


Typically, one can use the Markup tools on iPhone from the Photos app. But did you know you can access the Markup editor from other apps as well? The Markup editor can be accessed from the Files app, Messages, Emails, Notes, and others. Just open the photo in the desired app and then press the Edit or the Markup button to open the Markup editor. 
Use the following basic tips to get started with the Markup editor on iPhone. 

 
 Double-tap on the pens at the bottom to change the pen style and opacity. Double-tap on the eraser to change the eraser size and to switch between the pixel and object eraser. Tap on the (+) icon and select Text to add the text to the photos on your iPhone.  
 
## 2. Add Arrow, Chat Bubble, and Other Shapes to Image


Want to add an arrow or other shapes to an image? Thankfully, you don’t need to download any third-party app. The Markup editor on iPhone lets you add an arrow, speech bubble, and square and rectangular boxes to your pictures.
To do so, open the photo in the Markup editor. Then, tap on the (+) Add icon at the bottom and select Arrow or speech bubble from the menu. 
Use the two blue dots at the ends of the arrow to change its size. Or, drag the arrow by the green dot to tilt it. To change the color of the shape, tap on the shape and choose a different color from the bottom list.

 
## 3. Change Arrow or Shape Style


You can convert the regular arrow into a double-sided arrow or change the shape of the speech bubble in the Markup editor. First, add the arrow to your picture as shown above. Then, tap on the arrow and press the icon having two shapes at the bottom-left corner. Select the desired arrow style.

 
## 4. Fill Color in Shapes


Generally, you can only change the color of the shape border in the Markup editor. But if you dig down, you can actually fill the shape with the desired color.
To fill color in shapes, add the desired shape such as a square, rectangle, or speech bubble to the picture. Then, tap on the shape and press the icon at the bottom-left corner. Choose the black-colored shape to switch from a regular shape to a fillable shape. Then, select the desired color for the shape.

 
## 5. Hide Sensitive Information Using Markup Editor


The Markup editor doesn’t offer a direct blur tool. However, you can use workarounds to hide sensitive information in your images. Basically, you either have to draw using any brush in the Markup editor or add a fillable square shape on the text that you want to hide.

 
## 6. Duplicate Shapes


If you have added a shape and customized it to your liking, you don’t need to redo the steps if you want to add another shape with the same features. You can easily duplicate the shape in the Markup editor.
To do so, add the first shape and customize it. Then, tap on the shape added to your picture and select Duplicate from the menu. An exact copy of the shape will be added to the picture.

 
## 7. Convert Hand drawn Shapes to Perfect Shapes with Markup


The Markup editor only offers two perfect shapes by default: square and rectangle. But that doesn’t mean you cannot add other perfect shapes to your picture. The Markup editor offers a hidden feature to convert any hand-drawn shape into a perfect picture.
To do so, simply draw the desired shape on the picture using your finger and keep holding the shape until it converts into a perfect shape.
Pro Tip: If you prefer your hand-drawn shape over the transformed shape, press the Revert button at the top.

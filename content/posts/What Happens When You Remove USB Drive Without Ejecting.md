You'll be Shocked by the Devastating Consequences of Removing your USB Drive Without Ejecting It First!

Have you ever noticed the warning message that pops up on your computer screen when you try to remove a USB drive without safely ejecting it? You might be tempted to ignore it, but you shouldn't! Failing to eject your USB drive can lead to some devastating consequences.

Let's take a look at the reasons why ejecting your USB drive is so important.

Data Loss

One of the primary reasons to safely eject your USB drive is to prevent data loss. When you remove a USB drive without ejecting it, you don't give your computer a chance to close any files or programs that are currently in use. This can lead to corruption or permanent loss of data, which can be devastating if you have important files on your drive.

Drive Damage

Another reason to eject your USB drive is to prevent damage to the drive itself. When you forcefully remove the drive, you can cause physical damage to the USB connector or the drive's circuit board. This can lead to a broken or useless drive and may even cause damage to your computer's USB ports.

Security Risks

Removing a USB drive without safely ejecting it can also pose security risks. If you have sensitive data on your drive, leaving it connected to a computer without properly ejecting it can still give access to someone who uses the same computer after you disconnect the drive. Properly ejecting the drive ensures that no one can access your data after you have disconnected it from the computer.

How to Safely Eject Your USB Drive

Now that you understand the importance of safely ejecting your USB drive, it's time to learn how to do it!

Step 1: Close all open files and programs that are currently using the drive.

Step 2: Locate the USB icon in the system tray (usually located in the lower right-hand corner of your screen).

Step 3: Right-click on the icon and select "Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media" or "Eject."

Step 4: Wait until you see a notification or message telling you that it's safe to remove the USB drive.

Step 5: Safely remove the USB drive by gently pulling it out of the USB port.

In Conclusion

Removing your USB drive without safely ejecting it first can lead to data loss, drive damage, and security risks. Now that you understand the importance of ejecting your USB drive, it's time to make it a habit. Remember, it only takes a few seconds to safely eject your USB drive, but the consequences of not doing so can last a lifetime.

Let’s begin.

 
## Why Not Remove USB Drive Directly – Consequences


The effects of removing a USB drive from Windows computer without ejecting it first can be one or more of what is listed below:

 
Data fails to copy/transfer completelyLoss of data or filesDrive becomes corrupt and may be unusableApp or software may stop workingSystem may crash or become unresponsive requiring a force rebootWhen you reconnect USB drive, Windows may not recognize the USB drive and throw an error


Having said that, modern-day operating systems have come a long way. The instances of system crashes and corrupt and usable drives are far and few. It’s a disaster waiting to happen and you don’t want that, do you?

 
## How Windows PC Connects With USB Drive


A lot is happening in the background when you plug a pen drive to your computer’s USB port. The pen drive doesn’t have a battery to operate on its own so it will draw power from your computer to work. Many pen drives have a led light to denote that it is on and functioning. Now you know their function.
The first time you connect a drive, it will install drivers on your computer that will allow the computer and USB drive to establish a connection. Essentially, drivers allow them to talk to each other and read and write data back and forth.
Every storage drive like pen drive, hard disk, etc. has either a Master Boot Record (MBR) or Partition Boot Record (PBR) which contains a record of all the data (files and folders) stored on the drive. The Windows OS uses this file to figure out what data you have on the drive.
The entire process we just discussed will be over within 2-3 seconds. This is why these USB devices are called plug-n-play these days.

 
## How Windows Reads/Writes Data on USB Drive


The USB device is plugged in and is ready to read and write data to and fro. Now, what happens when you copy data from USB to your Windows computer’s internal drive or back? That will help us understand what happens when you remove USB drive directly without ejecting it first.
When you copy files from your Windows computer to the pen drive, you will see that the files are being moved in a pop-up and that the files are visible in the folder on your pen drive. But in reality, the files are saved in something called write caching. In layman’s terms, the files are stored in the cache memory and transferred in batches to the external drive. Now yanking out the storage drive without ejecting it first would result in loss of data that is lying in the cache memory and yet to be copied. Worse, the files are actually being transferred in the background but you don’t know it and it could corrupt both the data and the drive.

 
### Apps Using USB Drive in the Background


When you connect a USB drive with computer, there are other apps that are also trying to communicate it. Some examples can be cloud storage apps like Google Drive, media players like Plex, antivirus, and so. Their interaction depends on whether or not you have given permission to them. Ideally, you would see a notification pop-up the first time you plug in a pen or hard disk drive.
If you have an external drive with an led light, it may blink to denote that data is being written or files are in use. But to be sure, do read the pamphlet that came with it.

 
## Microsoft’s Dual Policy on Removing or Ejecting USB Drives


Microsoft wasn’t clear about the whole debate until recently. With the launch of Windows 10 and later 11, Microsoft released fresh guidelines where it recommends Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media. You would find the icon in the Taskbar. Sometimes, you will find it in the Show hidden icons menu that you can access by clicking on the up arrow.
However, in update 1809 for Windows 10, Microsoft changed the default policy for removing external storage media. You see, Microsoft has two policies for removing storage drive from your computer’s USB port. Let’s take a look at them.
With the recent update, Microsoft has changed the default policy from Better performance to Quick removal. Windows users always had the flexibility of choosing one of the two policies but the option is buried deep into settings and most don’t even know what they are looking for or that it even exists. That’s where we come in.

 
## How to Change USB Removal Policy on Windows 10 and 11


I will be using Windows 11 as an example here but the steps below will work on Windows 10 as well. Also, as noted above, update 1809 changes the default policy to Quick removal from Better performance.
To check your Windows version:
1. Press Windows+R to open the Run Prompt. Type winver and press Enter.
2. You will find the Windows OS and build version in the little pop-up that opens next.
Now, let’s check how to change the USB removal policy so you can choose what works for you when ejecting USB drives from your computer.
1. First, connect the USB drive that you want to set the removal policy for. You can set different removal policies for different drives.
2. Now press Windows+E to open File Explorer. Find the drive letter that represents the USB drive you just inserted. For me, that’s E drive.
3. Right-click on the Start button and select Disk Management.
4. At the bottom of the screen, right-click on the removable drive that you inserted and select Properties.
5. In the pop-up that follows, under the Policies tab, you can select Quick removal or Better performance. You will notice that the former is the default even in Windows 11 though the update only mentions Windows 10.
Note: If you select Better performance above, you can also edit Write-caching policy. We discuss how Windows will save data in cache memory and transfer them in batches to improve system performance. 

 
## Honesty Is the Policy


So, what should you do? And, why? Here’s my argument for choosing Quick removal policy which is the default set by Microsoft post recent update. The argument in favor of Better Performance is well, performance. But modern computers are powerful beasts and savvy users often upgrade their computers with additional RAM. How much of performance difference will it make? I am thinking not much. On the flip side, losing data is a much serious issue. Quick Removal removes the headache once and for all. Yank that stick all you want without having to worry about removing or ejecting USB drive.

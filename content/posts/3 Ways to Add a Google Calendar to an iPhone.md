Revolutionize Your Scheduling Game: Discover 3 Simple Hacks to Sync Your Google Calendar with Your iPhone Now!

Scheduling has always been a challenge for most of us, and not keeping up with your appointments can be a nightmare. Thankfully, technology has come to the rescue with smartphone apps like Google Calendar and iPhone Calendar. These apps make scheduling and reminder-setting a breeze. However, not being able to sync the two can lead to missing appointments.

We have all been there; appointments that we forgot to add on one calendar, and leave us wondering why we didn't get any notification until it was too late. That won't happen again, we promise!

We've got some great news that will revolutionize your scheduling game – syncing your Google Calendar with your iPhone Calendar is more accessible than you might think.

Here are three simple hacks that will help you sync your Google Calendar with your iPhone.

1. Sync Google Calendar with Apple Calendar App

The Apple Calendar App is the default calendar app on your iPhone, but you can use Google Calendar on the app too. The first step is to log in to your Google account on your iPhone. Go to the Settings App, scroll down to “Mail, Contacts, Calendar” and click on “Add Account.” Select Google, then login to your account.

Once you’ve logged in, your Google Calendar will appear as an option in the Apple Calendar App. Suppose you want to add an event to Google Calendar. In that case, you’ll have to make sure you add the event under the “Google” option on the “Calendar” section of the app.

2. Sync Google Calendar on iCloud

Another way to sync Google Calendar with your iPhone is through iCloud. This involves adding your Google account to your iCloud account. Once you do that, your events sync automatically.

First, go to your iPhone Settings, click on your name at the top of the screen, tap “iCloud,” and toggle on the “Calendars.” Next, go to “Passwords and Accounts” and select “Add Account > Google.” Once logged in, toggle on “Calendars.” After some time, your Google Calendar events will start to appear on your iPhone Calendar app.

3. Use Third-Party Applications

There are many third-party applications like Calendars 5, Outlook, Fantastical, or BusyCal that can help you sync your Google Calendar with your iPhone. These applications act as a virtual assistant that syncs and combines several calendars like Outlook, Google Calendar, and even Facebook Events.

After downloading any of these apps, open the app, and connect to your Google Calendar account. You will be able to view and modify your Google events and receive notifications when an event is about to start.

Conclusion

Syncing your Google Calendar with your iPhone Calendar reduces the stress of scheduling and helps you stay up-to-date with your appointments. Using the methods highlighted above, you can easily sync your Google Calendar events with your iPhone in minutes. Keep in mind, though, that syncing only works if you have a stable internet connection. So, make sure you check your connection before syncing your calendars.

Revolutionize your scheduling game by implementing the above tricks, and never miss an appointment again!

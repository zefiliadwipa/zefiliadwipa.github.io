# Blocking a Number on Android and iPhone - You Won't Believe the Shocking Results!

Whether it's a telemarketer bothering you with unsolicited phone calls, an overly clingy ex-partner, or a colleague with a knack for sending annoying text messages, sometimes you just need to block someone's number. Luckily, both Android and iPhone devices offer a way to do just that.

At first glance, it seems like a simple process - on an iPhone, you go to the contact or the phone call log, tap the 'i' icon next to the number, and scroll down to find the 'Block this Caller' option. Similarly, on an Android device, you go to the phone app, long-press on the number you want to block, and select 'Block' or 'Add to Auto-Reject List.'

But did you know that blocking a number can have some unexpected, even shocking consequences? Here are a few things you might not know about blocking a number on Android and iPhone.

## You won't receive calls or texts anymore from that number

This may seem obvious, but it bears mentioning. When you block a number, you won't receive any calls, texts, or voicemails from that number anymore. This could be a relief if you're being constantly harassed, but it also means that you might miss important messages from that person.

There's also a chance that the person may not realize they've been blocked and keep trying to contact you, leading to awkward or uncomfortable situations. Therefore, it's important to think carefully before blocking someone's number and consider whether there might be other ways to resolve the issue.

## The blocked number may still be able to leave voicemails

While you won't get any notifications or alerts about missed calls or texts from a blocked number, it's possible that they may still be able to leave voicemails. On an iPhone, the voicemail will go straight to the 'Blocked Messages' folder, which you can access by going to the main 'Voicemail' tab and scrolling down to the bottom. On some Android devices, blocked numbers may also be able to leave voicemails.

It's worth checking this folder periodically to make sure that you haven't missed any important messages. If you find that a blocked number is leaving frequent or harassing voicemails, you may need to take more drastic measures to protect yourself, such as contacting your phone carrier or even the police.

## You may see unexpected behavior in group messages

If you've blocked someone's number and they happen to be in a group chat with you, you may notice some odd behavior in the chat. For example, on an iPhone, you won't receive any messages from the blocked person, but you may still see their name in the chat when other people mention them. On some Android devices, you may not be able to see the entire group chat if the blocked number is part of it.

This can be confusing or frustrating, especially if the group chat is for a work or school project. In some cases, you may need to ask the other members of the chat to remove the blocked person or start a new chat without them.

## You can unblock a number just as easily as you can block it

If you eventually decide that you want to unblock a number, you can do so just as easily as you blocked it. On an iPhone, go to Settings > Phone > Blocked Contacts, and tap 'Edit' in the upper-right corner. Then tap the red circle next to the blocked number you want to remove and tap 'Unblock.' On an Android device, go to Phone > Settings > Blocked Numbers, find the number you want to unblock, and tap the 'X' next to it.

It's important to remember that unblocking a number may not undo any damage that was caused by blocking it in the first place. If you've missed important messages or caused hurt feelings by blocking a number, you may need to apologize and explain your reasoning before trying to re-establish contact.

Blocking a number on your Android or iPhone can be a useful tool for managing your communication and protecting yourself from unwanted contact. However, it's important to use this tool wisely and understand the potential consequences. By considering all the factors at play, you can make an informed decision about when and how to block a number.

## What Happens to Calls When You Block Someone


When you block a number, mainly regular phone calls are affected. Basically, when you block a number on your Android or iPhone, you won’t receive regular phone calls from it. That is, the calls from the blocked number will be declined automatically.
On some networks, the calls are sent to Voicemail but don’t worry, you won’t receive voicemail notifications either. So it’s equivalent to not receiving calls at all. In a nutshell, blocking a number prevents them from calling you.
However, blocking contact is only effective in one direction. That is, you can still communicate with the blocked person from your end, which means you can call them even if you have blocked them.
Tip: Check out 10+ ways to fix iPhone not receiving calls but can make them. 

 
## What Happens to Messages After Blocking a Number


The next major impact of blocking a number is on SMS messages. When you block a number on Android or iPhone, that number cannot send you a regular text message (SMS or MMS). Even though the message will be sent from the sender’s side but you won’t receive the message.
Messages, like calls, have a one-way impact. You can message the blocked person, but you will not receive a response from the blocked contact.

 
## What Other Apps Are Affected


Blocking a number via the Phone app, Contacts, or Settings will only affect regular calls and messages on Android. The blocked number can still contact you on other apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. You need to block the person separately on these apps.
On iOS, however, things are slightly different as it affects FaceTime and iMessage as well. That is, the blocked number cannot FaceTime or iMessage you on your iPhone. Furthermore, you will not receive emails from the blocked contact on the Apple Email app, if an e-mail ID is associated with the blocked contact. 
Apart from FaceTime, iMessage, and Email, no other app is affected on iOS as well. You will still receive messages and calls on other apps like WhatsApp, Instagram, etc., from the blocked person. 
Tip: Learn how to use FaceTime links to call people. 

 
## What Happens When the Blocked Person Calls You


When a blocked contact tries to call you, they will hear different things based on your carrier. For instance, some might be greeted by pre-recorded messages like the number is busy, the number is not reachable, the number cannot take calls, etc., Others will hear one ring before the call disconnects automatically.  

 
## Does the Other Person Know That You Blocked Them


Not really. Firstly, because they will hear pre-recorded messages when they call you, and their messages are also shown as sent. Secondly, the contact will not be notified or sent a message that you have blocked them. However, after a few attempts, they may be able to guess that something is fishy.

 
## Does Blocking a Number Delete It From Your Contacts


No. Blocking a number will not delete it from your contacts. If you decide to unblock the number in the future, it will still be available in your contacts. 

 
## What Happens After Unblocking a Number


After you unblock a number, the contact will regain the normal capabilities of being able to call and message you. However, you won’t receive the messages that were sent when the number was blocked. Similarly, you cannot see call history details for the blocked number after unblocking it.

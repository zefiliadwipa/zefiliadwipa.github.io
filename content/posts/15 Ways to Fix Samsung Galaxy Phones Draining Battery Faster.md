Title: Stop the Battery Drain: Discover the 15 Must-Know Secrets to Save Your Samsung Galaxy Phone's Lifespan!

Introduction:

A smartphone has become an essential device in our everyday life. One of the crucial components of a smartphone is the battery. The battery powers your device and keeps it running. However, if you're a Samsung Galaxy phone user, you would know that battery drainage is one problem that no one wants to deal with. It's frustrating to have your phone running out of battery in the middle of the day. Battery drainage can be caused by various factors such as apps, screen brightness, and software updates. In this article, we'll be discussing 15 must-know secrets to save your Samsung Galaxy Phone's lifespan.

Secret 1: Adjust screen brightness

One of the biggest battery drains on any smartphone is the screen brightness. Fortunately, Samsung phones come with a feature that enables you to adjust the screen's brightness automatically. Go to Settings > Display > Brightness to adjust the brightness level. You can also enable/disable the 'Adaptive brightness' feature that adjusts the screen brightness based on the ambient light.

Secret 2: Use dark mode

Another way to save your phone's battery is by using dark mode. The dark mode feature changes your phone's interface to dark colors, reducing the amount of power your screen consumes. To enable dark mode, go to Settings > Display > Dark mode.

Secret 3: Turn off vibration

Vibration motor is the component responsible for vibrating your phone when you receive a call or notification. This feature is also a battery drain. To disable it, go to Settings > Sounds and vibration > Vibration intensity > Select 'None.'

Secret 4: Enable power-saving mode

Power-saving mode is a feature that adjusts your phone's performance to save battery life. Go to Settings > Device care > Battery > Power mode, and enable "medium power saving" or "max power saving" mode.

Secret 5: Close unnecessary apps

Multitasking is a great feature of Samsung Galaxy phones. However, running several apps consumes your phone's battery. Close the apps that you're not using by tapping the 'Recent apps' button and swiping them off the screen.

Secret 6: Reduce screen timeout

Reducing the screen timeout period is another way to save your phone's battery. Go to Settings > Display > Screen timeout and select a shorter time, say 15 seconds or 30 seconds.

Secret 7: Disable Always-on display

Always-on display displays essential information on your screen when the phone is locked. However, this feature is a battery drain. Go to Settings > Lock screen > Always-on display, and toggle it off.

Secret 8: Disable GPS

Disabling GPS can also save your phone's battery. Some apps use your phone's GPS to track your location, but if you're not using any app that requires GPS, toggle it off in your phone's quick settings.

Secret 9: Fully charge and discharge your phone

Every phone battery has a lifecycle. To maintain your phone's battery, make sure to fully discharge and fully charge it once a month.

Secret 10: Use original chargers

Using original chargers ensures that your phone's battery is charged correctly. Make sure to use the original Samsung charger or any charger that's compatible with your phone.

Secret 11: Avoid overcharging your phone

Overcharging is another common mistake that can damage your phone's battery. To avoid overcharging your phone, unplug it when it's fully charged.

Secret 12: Use the right charging cable

Using the wrong charging cable can damage your phone's battery, leading to battery drainage. Make sure to use a charging cable that's compatible with your phone.

Secret 13: Update your phone's software

Regular software updates help fix common bugs and improve your phone's performance. These updates also optimize your phone's battery usage.

Secret 14: Keep your phone's temperature moderate

Extreme temperatures can damage your phone's battery, leading to battery drainage. Keep your phone's temperature moderate and avoid exposing it to extreme heat or cold.

Secret 15: Use battery-saving apps

There are several battery-saving apps available on the Play Store. These apps help extend your phone's battery life by limiting performance or optimizing it for power-saving.

Conclusion:

Samsung Galaxy phones are undoubtedly among the best smartphones in the market. However, their batteries are susceptible to drainage due to various factors. Following the 15 must-know secrets shared in this article will help you extend your phone's battery lifespan and save the frustration of having your phone run out of battery in the middle of the day.

## 1. Lower Screen Refresh Rate


If you are using your Samsung Galaxy phone at the 120hz refresh rate all the time, this might be why the battery is draining so quickly.
1. Open the Settings app from the app drawer and tap on Display.
2. Now tap on Motion smoothness.
3. Tap on Standard to select it.
4. Tap on Apply to confirm the setting.

 
## 2. Use Adaptive Brightness


Many people adjust the brightness on their Samsung Galaxy phones manually. And many times, we max out the brightness when needed but forget to lower it later resulting in battery drain. Switching to adaptive brightness will save you some battery juice for emergencies. Let’s learn how to do so on our Samsung Galaxy phones.
1. Open the Settings app on your Galaxy phone and tap on Display.
2. Turn the toggle on right next to Adaptive brightness. Now the Adaptive brightness has been turned on for your Samsung Galaxy phone.

 
## 3. Lower Screen Resolution


Many Samsung Galaxy phones have QHD+ resolution nowadays. It might make your display look good when using the max resolution but affects the battery life as every pixel on the display of your Samsung Galaxy phone is draining the power from the battery. Hence, switching to a lower resolution is going to save you a lot of battery. 
1. Open the Settings app and then go to Display.
2. Tap on Screen resolution to begin.
3. Tap on HD+ to select the lowest resolution.
4. Now tap on Apply to confirm the resolution.

 
## 4. Use Dark Mode


Light Mode always maxes out the brightness of white pixels i.e, displayed on the screen most of the time. So switching to Dark Mode instead of Light Mode will also help reduce battery drain on your Samsung Galaxy phone. Let’s take a look at how to enable Dark Mode on your Samsung Galaxy phone.
1. Open Settings and tap on Display.
2. Tap on Dark, to switch to the dark mode.

 
## 5. Check Battery and Device Care Settings


To minimize battery drain, you can also check the Battery and Device Care settings on your Samsung Galaxy phone. With the help of Battery and Device Care settings, you can put unused apps to sleep and also enable adaptive battery on your Galaxy phone. Let’s take a look at how to do so.

 
### Put Unused Apps to Sleep


1. Navigate to the Settings app on your Galaxy phone and tap to open it.
2. Scroll down the Settings page and tap on Battery and device care option.
3. Now tap on Battery.
4. Tap on Background usage limits.
Pro Tip: You can also enable Power saving mode from here to make your Galaxy phone last longer, but it will limit some device functionality like vibration, sync, etc.
5. Turn on the toggle next to Put unused apps to sleep. It will try to put unused apps to sleep whenever it can to save some battery.

 
### Turn On Adaptive Battery


1. Open Settings and go back to the same Battery settings page as above. Or you can also navigate to the battery settings page by going to Settings > Battery and device care > Battery.
2. Scroll down the Battery settings page and tap on More battery settings.
3. Turn the toggle next to the Adaptive battery.

 
## 6. Lower Screen Timeout Setting


If your phone is running on a higher screen timeout setting, this might also be a big factor in why your Samsung Galaxy phone’s battery is draining so quickly. To fix this, let’s take a look at the steps below.
1. Navigate to the Settings app and tap to open it.
2. Scroll down and tap on Display.
3. Now tap on Screen timeout.
4. Tap on the lowest preferred timeout option to select it.

 
## 7. Stop Rogue Apps Running in the Background


Sometimes there are many apps running in the background which will cause the battery to drain faster on your Samsung Galaxy phone. Let’s take a look at where to find those rogue running apps and how to stop them for good.
1. Open Settings again and scroll towards the bottom and tap on About phone.
2. Tap on Software information.
3. Now repeatedly tap on the Build number until you see a message on the screen saying “You’re now a developer.”.
Note: While turning on the Developer Mode, it might ask for the password/pin/pattern after step 3 if you have set any on your Galaxy phone.
4. Now go back to Settings and tap on Developer options.
5. Tap on Running services.
6. Scroll and tap on the app/service that you’re not using but is running rogue in the background.
7. Now tap on Stop. You can repeat this process with multiple apps in the running services until you’re satisfied.

## 8. Keep Useful Apps Minimized


If you’re one of those people who likes to clear their recent apps, this is the right time to stop that practice. Every time you close an app and reopen it after a while, your Galaxy phone uses extra resources as compared to when it was just minimized. This will put stress on the battery of your Samsung Galaxy in a long run. So instead of clearing the recent apps, I would suggest you remove or kill only those apps that you’re not going to use for the day.

 
## 9. Turn off Data


Just like calls, always on data can also cause the battery of your Samsung Galaxy phone to drain faster. If your phone has a smaller battery and you keep your data always on, the chances are that it is going to obliterate your battery. So when the data is not required turning it off might save you some battery. Let’s take a look at how to turn off the data on your Samsung Galaxy phone.
1. Swipe down from the top of your screen to access the quick panel.
2. Tap on the Data icon to turn it off.

 
## 10. Avoid Being Always on Call


The modems installed in your Galaxy phone can also drain the battery of your Samsung Galaxy phone. When you are on a call for a long time your phone uses a significant amount of battery to keep the call connected. Which in turn will make you charge your phone frequently. To stop the draining of battery at a faster rate of your Galaxy phone try to limit your call sessions or try using flight mode when you are not attending any calls to save some juice.

 
## 11. Give Your Phone a Rest or Restart


Sometimes we forget to switch off or reboot our Galaxy phone for a long time. In that case, your phone might stutter and drop some battery. To prevent this, you should try switching off or rebooting your phone once or twice a week. Let’s take a look at how to do so.
1. Long press the power button of your Samsung Galaxy phone to reveal the power options.
2. Now tap on Power off.
3. Again tap on Power off to switch the phone off.
Pro Tip: If you don’t want to power off and then power on again then tap on Restart.

 
## 12. Revoke Location Permission of Unnecessary Apps


Multiple apps accessing location services or GPS in the background is also a common problem when it comes to the battery drain issue. To stop an app from accessing the location in the background:
1. Open Settings and tap on Location to open the location settings.
2. Tap on App permissions.
Pro Tip: You can also take a look at the Recent access section on the Location page to figure out which app has accessed your location recently.
3. Select the app for which you want to revoke the location permission.
4. Tap on Don’t allow.
Note: If the app doesn’t need location permission to function, select Don’t allow or you can also choose to Ask every time or Allow only while using the app.
5. Tap on Don’t allow anyway and the app won’t be using location service anymore.

 
## 13. Keep Your Phone Away From Direct Sunlight


The battery can also drain faster if you are using your Samsung Galaxy phone in direct sunlight for a longer period of time. Samsung Galaxy phones use Lithium ions battery which isn’t good when it comes to performing in hotter temperatures. So if you find your battery draining faster than usual and you are in the sun for a longer period of time, I would suggest you let your phone cool down a bit. 

 
## 14. Using Phone While Charging


There’s one more practice that can make the battery of your Galaxy phone drain faster i.e, using it while charging. Using the phone and charging both at the same time can make your device too hot. And heat is one of the biggest enemies of batteries. So if you find yourself using your phone while charging, chances are you might see a significant drop in the battery or slow charging. I would suggest you first charge your Galaxy phone completely and then use it if possible.

 
## 15. Using Max Vibration Intensity


Many Samsung Galaxy phones allow users to customize vibration sensitivity. And using the max setting for vibration can also deplete the battery of your Samsung Galaxy phone pretty quickly. Let’s take a look at how to lower the vibration intensity on Samsung Galaxy phones.
1. Open the Settings app and tap on Sound and vibration.
2. Now tap on Vibration intensity.
3. Slide the slider towards the left to decrease the intensity of the vibration. And now the vibration motor will be using less power as compared to earlier.

 
## Revive Your Samsung Galaxy


In a nutshell, either one of the reasons or a combination of reasons mentioned above might be the culprit for why the battery is draining faster than usual on your Samsung Galaxy phone. Go ahead and try to fix these issues and you will find a significant difference between the before and after. Just with a little bit of troubleshooting and a change in the usage pattern of your Galaxy phone, you can make it last longer than usual. I hope these reasons were helpful to you in finding out the cause of a faster battery drain on your Samsung Galaxy phone.

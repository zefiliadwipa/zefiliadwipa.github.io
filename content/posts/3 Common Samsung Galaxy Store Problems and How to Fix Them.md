Once you complete the above steps, Galaxy Store should no longer bother you with annoying notifications on your Samsung phone.

2. Go to Permissions and disable all the permissions one by one.

## What Happens When You Disable Galaxy Store on Your Samsung Phone 


Although disabling Galaxy Store on your Samsung phone might sound like a win, there are some consequences to this action.

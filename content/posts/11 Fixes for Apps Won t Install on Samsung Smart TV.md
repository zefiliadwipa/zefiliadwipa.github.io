## 1. Restart Your TV by Unplugging


The first thing that you must try if your Samsung TV isn’t downloading apps is to restart your smart TV. For that, you simply need to disconnect the power supply to the TV for at least 10-20 seconds. You can do it by unplugging the power cable or turning off the switch. Then, turn on the TV again.

 
## 2. Restart Samsung TV Using the Remote


Another way to restart your Samsung TV is by using the Power button on the remote. This is one of the proven fixes to resolve the issue of apps won’t install on Samsung smart TV.
Just hold the Power button on the remote for 5-10 seconds until the Samsung logo appears on the screen. The screen will turn off when you are holding the remote button. Do not leave the Power button until the logo appears.

 
## 3. Restart Modem


Your Samsung TV might not be installing apps because of a bad internet connection. Start by restarting your Wi-Fi modem. If that doesn’t fix the issue, open any streaming app and see if you are able to watch content. If installed apps also do not work, the problem could be in your internet connection. Check the next fix for that. 

 
## 4. Check Internet Connection


If the TV is far away from your router, that could also be causing the apps not installing issue on Samsung smart TV. Therefore, you must try to keep the smart TV close to your Wi-Fi router. Also, make sure you haven’t changed the Wi-Fi password recently. Otherwise, you would need to enter the new password on your TV as well. Check out other ways to fix Wi-Fi not working on Samsung TV.

## 5. Update TV Software


Many times, outdated firmware on your Samsung smart TV can also cause issues with the installation of new apps on the TV. Therefore, you must first update your TV’s software before you install or update apps.
To do so, go to TV Settings from the home screen. Or press the Settings button on your remote. 
Then, go to Support > Software update > Update now. Your smart TV will start installing the update if available.

 
## 6. Check Storage


Your TV must have enough storage space to install or update new apps. If the storage space on your TV is low, you will face issues while installing new apps on your TV.
To check the available storage, follow these steps:
1. On your TV, go to Settings > Support > Device care.
2. Select Manage storage.
3. You will see the used and available storage at the top. If the storage is full, uninstall the apps that you don’t use on your TV. Learn how to uninstall and manage apps on Samsung smart TV.

To clear the cache of any app, follow these steps:
1. Go to TV Settings > Support > Device care > Manage storage.
2. Select the View details button under the app whose cache you want to clear.
3. Then, select the Clear cache button.
4. Restart your TV.
5. If the apps still aren’t downloading on your Samsung TV, select the Clear Data button in step 3.

 
## 9. Uninstall the Problematic App


If you are unable to update an app, you should try reinstalling it. However, first, you must check if the problem is specific to that particular app or all apps. If the problem is with that app only, uninstall it. Once installed, then try installing it back.

 
## 10. Log out of Samsung Account


To fix the issue of apps not installing on Samsung Smart TV, you must try logging out from your Samsung account.
To log out from your Samsung account on TV, follow these steps:

## 11. Factory Reset TV


If nothing helps in fixing Samsung TV not installing apps issue, the final resort is to factory reset your smart TV. Doing so will restore your TV to its original condition, thus deleting all the manually installed apps and customized settings.
To factory reset your TV, go to Settings > General > Reset. You might have to enter the PIN. The default PIN is 0000 in case you haven’t changed it.

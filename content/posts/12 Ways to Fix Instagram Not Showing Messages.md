Are you tired of sending messages on Instagram only to feel like you're being ignored? Don't worry - you're not alone! Instagram can be pretty complex at times, and it's easy for messages to get lost in the shuffle. But with these 12 simple hacks, you can ensure your messages get noticed and your communication on Instagram runs smoothly!

## 1. Make sure you're connected to the internet

It might sound obvious, but before you start troubleshooting, make sure you're connected to the internet. If you're not connected, your messages won't go through, and you'll just be left wondering why your messages aren't being seen. Simple but crucial!

## 2. Update your Instagram app

If you're not using the latest version of Instagram, it might not function properly or have the most recent features. Updating your app can fix any bugs or glitches that are causing your messages to be ignored.

## 3. Clear your Instagram cache

Sometimes, Instagram's cache can become cluttered, which can cause it to malfunction. Clearing your Instagram cache can fix this issue and help your messages get seen.

## 4. Check your message requests folder

Instagram has a separate message requests folder for messages from people you don't follow. Be sure to check this folder to see if your messages have been sent there.

## 5. Ensure the person isn't blocking you

If someone is blocking you on Instagram, you won't be able to send them messages. Make sure to double-check if they have blocked you before worrying about why your messages aren't being seen.

## 6. Send a direct message instead of a comment

If you're trying to reach someone through a comment, it's easy for your message to get lost among all the other comments on a post. Sending a direct message will ensure your message is seen and replied to.

## 7. Tag the person in your post

If you're trying to get someone's attention, tag them in your post or story. This will send them a notification and increase the likelihood that they'll see your message.

## 8. Keep it short and sweet

Long messages can be overwhelming and easy to skip over, especially if the person is receiving a lot of messages. Keep your messages short and sweet to ensure they get read.

## 9. Be persistent but not annoying

If you don't receive a reply to your first message, it's okay to send a follow-up message. But don't be too pushy or send too many messages, or the person may become annoyed or ignore you altogether.

## 10. Use emojis and visuals

Messages that incorporate emojis and visuals are more engaging and attention-grabbing. Try using them in your messages to increase the chances of them getting seen.

## 11. Interact with the person's content

If you're trying to get someone's attention, interact with their content by liking and commenting on their posts. This can show that you're genuinely interested and increase the likelihood of your messages being seen.

## 12. Try sending your messages at different times

If you're consistently sending messages at the same time of day, try shaking it up and sending them at different times. This can increase the likelihood of them being seen and replied to.

By implementing these 12 simple hacks, you can ensure your messages on Instagram get seen and your communication runs smoothly. So next time you're feeling ignored on Instagram, don't worry. Just try these hacks, and you'll soon be back on track!

## 1. Check Internet Connection


Internet connection is a common issue that goes unnoticed at various times. If you are having trouble with Instagram, please check your internet connection i.e, your data pack, Wi-Fi, speed, etc. Please make sure your internet is working seamlessly in order for Instagram to work effortlessly. If your internet is working fine, then let’s move on to the next solution.

 
## 2. Try Instagram Web


If Instagram is not showing you messages on your mobile, you should try checking your messages on the Instagram web app. It will help figure out if the problem lies with mobile or web browsers. Let’s take a look at how to access your DMs on the web version of Instagram.

## 3. Message Was Unsent


One more possible reason for Instagram no longer displaying messages is that the user may have unsent the message.

You can ask them in order to confirm.

4. Now tap on Unmute.
5. Tap on Unmute messges to unmute the DM of the person.

 
## 5. Unblock Person

3. Now tap on Settings.

## 12. Limited by Instagram


Instagram has safeguards to protect users from spam. One of them is a limit on how many messages can be sent in a given time period.

Ask your Instagram friend to wait before resending the message so it will be visible on your end.

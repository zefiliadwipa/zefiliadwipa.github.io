# Revamp Your Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 and 5 Pro with These 2 Game-Changing Button Customization Hacks!

If you are a Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 or 5 Pro user, you may have noticed that the default button layout doesn't always cater to all your needs. Thankfully, there are ways to change it, and in this article, we will show you two game-changing button customization hacks that can help you revamp your smartwatch and take productivity to the next level.

## Hack #1: Swap the Order of the Back and Home Buttons

One of the most common complaints about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 and 5 Pro is the placement of the back and home buttons. The back button is on the top, while the home button is on the bottom. This can be confusing for some users, especially those who are used to a different layout. Fortunately, there is a way to swap the order of these buttons.

To do this, you need to download and install the "Wearable Widgets" app on your smartphone. This app will allow you to create widgets that can be placed on your watch face, including one that will swap the back and home buttons.

Once you have installed the app, follow these steps:

1. Open Wearable Widgets on your smartphone and select "Create Widget."

2. Choose "Shortcut."

3. Scroll down and select "Quick Settings."

4. Choose "Settings."

5. Tap "Back and Plus Button Swap."

6. Customize the various settings and tap "Create Widget."

7. Place the widget on your watch face.

Once the widget is placed, you can use it to swap the order of the back and home buttons whenever you need it, providing a more intuitive experience over time.

## Hack #2: Launch Your Favorite Apps with a Single Press

Another great customization hack is to launch your favorite apps with a single press of a button. This can save you a lot of time and hassle when navigating your watch, especially if you use specific apps frequently.

To set this up, follow these steps:

1. Open the Galaxy Wearable app on your smartphone.

2. Tap on "Watch Faces and Styles."

3. Choose the watch face you want to customize and select "Customize."

4. Tap on "Shortcut."

5. Choose the shortcut you want to set, such as an app, contact, or quick settings.

6. Customize the shortcut and press "Done."

7. The shortcut will now appear on your watch face.

With this feature, you can launch your favorite apps with a single press, rather than having to navigate multiple menus and submenus. This saves time and improves productivity.

## In Conclusion

Customizing the buttons on your Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 and 5 Pro can significantly enhance your user experience. By swapping the back and home buttons and launching your favorite apps with a single press, you can create a more intuitive and efficient user interface, making your watch work for you. Try these two game-changing button customization hacks and take your productivity to the next level.

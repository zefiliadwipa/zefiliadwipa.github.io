# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is! 3 Foolproof Ways to Remove Sound From Your Videos on Android ðŸ˜±ðŸ”‡

If you're an avid Android user, you've probably experienced the frustration of recording a video with unwanted background noise. Whether you're at a concert, a crowded shopping mall, or simply recording in a noisy environment, removing sound from your videos can be a daunting task. But fear not! With the right tools and techniques, removing sound from your Android videos can be a breeze. In this article, we'll explore three foolproof ways to remove sound from your videos on Android.

## Method 1: Edit Your Videos Using a Video Editing App

One of the easiest ways to remove sound from your videos on Android is by using a video editing app. There are several video editing apps available on the Google Play Store that allow you to edit and customize your videos. Some of the most popular video editing apps include KineMaster, PowerDirector, and FilmoraGo.

To remove sound from your video using a video editing app, simply import your video into the app and look for the audio track. Most video editing apps have an option to mute or delete the audio track. Select this option, and you're done! The sound from your video has been removed.

## Method 2: Use a Video Converter App

Another way to remove sound from your Android videos is by using a video converter app. A video converter app allows you to convert your video into a different format, which can help remove the audio track.

One of the most popular video converter apps for Android is VidCompact. To remove sound from your video using VidCompact, simply import your video into the app and select the "mute" option. VidCompact will convert your video into a new format with the sound removed.

## Method 3: Use Google Photos

If you're looking for a simple and easy way to remove sound from your Android videos, consider using Google Photos. Google Photos is a free app that allows you to store and organize your photos and videos.

To remove sound from your video using Google Photos, simply upload your video to the app and select the "Edit" option. From there, select the "Mute" option, and voila! The sound from your video has been removed.

## Conclusion

Removing sound from your videos on Android doesn't have to be a daunting task. With the right tools and techniques, you can quickly and easily remove sound from your videos. Whether you choose to use a video editing app, a video converter app, or Google Photos, you'll be able to remove the sound from your videos in no time. So go ahead and give it a try â€“ you won't believe how easy it is! ðŸ”‡


## 1. Use Google Photos to Remove Sound From Video


Google Photos is arguably the best gallery app on Android. Itâ€™s jam-packed with various photo and video editing features. Among other options, it also lets you remove audio from a video with ease.
Here are the steps you can follow.
1. Open Google Photos on your phone and navigate to the video from which you want to remove the sound.
2. Tap the Edit option at the bottom to open your video in Google Photosâ€™ video editor. Then, in the Video tab, tap the speaker icon to mute the audio.
3. Lastly, tap the Save copy button in the bottom right corner. 
And thatâ€™s about it. Google Photos will save your video without audio as a separate file.Â 

 
## 2. Use Samsung Gallery App to Remove Sound From Video


If you have a Samsung Galaxy phone, you may prefer using its default Gallery app instead of Google Photos. Luckily, Samsungâ€™s Gallery app also includes a slew of video editing tools. Hereâ€™s how you can use it to remove audio from a video.
1. Open the Gallery app on your Samsung phone and navigate to your video.Â 
2. Tap the pencil icon at the bottom to open your video in the video editor.Â 
3. Tap the speaker icon in the bottom left corner and then use the slider to turn the Video volume all the way down.Â 
Tip: One major benefit of using the Samsung Gallery app over Google Photos is that it also gives you the option to replace the audio in your video. To do so, tap the Add background music option and use any audio from your phone.
4. Lastly, tap on Save as copy in the top right corner, and your video will be saved as a separate file.Â 
Apart from removing audio, the video editor on your Samsung phone also allows you to easily trim, crop, and rotate videos.

 
## 3. Use the Canva App to Remove Sound From Video


Canva has emerged as a popular design tool in recent times. Whether you want to create logos, eye-catching Instagram posts, or edit a video, Canva provides all the necessary options. So, in case you donâ€™t want to use the built-in gallery app or just want more options, you can use the Canva app on your phone to remove audio from any video.Â Hereâ€™s how:
1. Download and install the Canva app on your Android. Sign in using your Google or Facebook account and allow all the necessary app permissions.
2. In your phoneâ€™s gallery, open the video from which you want to remove the sound. Tap the share icon at the bottom and select Canva from the share sheet.Â 
3. Select your preferred size for the video and tap the right checkmark at the top. This will open your video in Canvaâ€™s video editor.
4. Tap on your video and you should see some options at the bottom. Scroll through them and tap on Volume.
5. Turn off the Volume toggle to mute your video. Alternatively, you can use the slider to decrease the volume level to your liking.Â 
6. Tap the export icon in the top right corner and select Download from the menu that appears.Â 
7. Use the drop-down menu under File type to select the suggested option and tap on Download.Â 
Wait for a few moments and Canva will save your edited video.
Besides Android, you can use the Canva app to remove audio from videos on your iPhone or computer as well.Â 

 
## Silence Is Golden


Aside from the methods listed above, you can also use a dedicated video editing app like InShot to remove sound from a video on your Android. Alternatively, you can use a website like AudioRemover to do the same. However, that would require you to upload your video to that websiteâ€™s server. If you ask us, itâ€™s best to stick to the trustworthy options as much as possible.

## 10. Screen recorder

The Screen recorder feature allows you to record your phone's screen, with or without audio. This feature is useful for users who want to record tutorials, gameplay, or capture important moments on their phone.

## 11. Live Transcribe

Live Transcribe is a feature that transcribes audio into text in real-time, making it easier for hearing-impaired users to follow conversations.

## 12. Bixby Routines

Bixby Routines is an intelligent feature that learns your routine and automatically performs tasks for you. You can customize Bixby Routines to perform tasks such as turning on/off Wi-Fi, setting your phone on vibrate mode during meetings, and enabling silent mode during your bedtime.

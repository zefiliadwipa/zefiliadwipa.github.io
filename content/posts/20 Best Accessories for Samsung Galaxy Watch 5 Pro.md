## Best Accessories for Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro


Let’s get started with watch bands for the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and take it from there.

 
## 1. Samsung Galaxy Watch Sport Bands


The sport band is the most popular and they are also directly sold by Samsung. Sport bands for Galaxy Watch 5 Pro are available in 5 different colors — white, pink gold, sapphire, graphite, and purple. They are plain, simple, and single-colored, and the quality is just like the default bands provided by Samsung. These bands are not made for the Watch 5 Pro specifically, but they do fit perfectly on the Pro model too. It costs $39.99.

## 2. Samsung Two-Tone Sport Bands


There are many things common between sports bands and two-tone sports bands. Both are made by Samsung, cost the same, and are available in the Samsung Store itself. Except for a different colored border, there is not much of a difference in the model too. However, they are available in new and different colors like navy, sand, and red. Along with the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, these are also compatible with Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 5 models.

## 3. LDFAS Leather Band
 
## 4. Nereides Nylon Woven Loop Sports Strap
 
## 5. Samsung Metal Link Bracelet


In case you prefer a vintage metal bracelet strap instead of rubber, leather, or nylon, then you can get one from Samsung. They are available in black and grey. While the quality is good, they are more on the expensive side costing around $299.99. But they stand up to their quality with the titanium-made strap and magnetic buckle. Unlike previous straps, they are only compatible with the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro as they come in bigger 46mm sizes.

## 6. Spigen Modern Fit Band


While Samsung’s metal band is costly, other third-party metal bands are much more affordable. The best is Spigen’s fit band, which comes in black, rose gold, and silver colors. They only cost $19.99, whereas the rose gold one gets a price cut every now and then and is currently available for only $12.99. Unlike the original Samsung metal straps, this one is made out of stainless steel, but the quality and reviews are good as usual.
Let me cycle through more premium watch bands that you may like.

 
## 7. The Samsung Nest Black and Gold Stainless Steel Band


Further, better models are available on the Samsung Nest website. The black and gold stainless steel band looks stunning and has a premium feel. It costs $69.99 and comes with a tool kit to remove a few links in the band to adjust the size. It also comes with four additional pins to replace lost pins to lock the strap in place. The company claims it works on Garmin watches too, but they definitely do work great on the Galaxy Watch 5 Pros.

## 8. The Samsung Nest Carbon Fiber Band


Another unique watch band is the carbon fiber which costs $129.99. Similar to the previous watch bands, this also comes with a tool kit and pins to adjust the size. While the band is more on the pricier side, it looks premium and much more expensive.

## 9. The Samsung Nest Black Mesh Loop Watch Band


A lot of people like the mesh loop watch band from the Samsung Nest. It costs just $59.99 but is available on sale at $39.99 at the time of writing this article. The mesh design watch strap is lightweight and works with previous Galaxy Watches and also Garmin watches just like previous Samsung Nest bands.

## 10. Spigen Rugged Armor Pro Band and Case


While all the previous Galaxy Watch 5 Pro bands were more about design and style, this band is mostly about increasing the rigidity of the device. Also, unlike other bands, this comes with a case. They both have a similar style and feel giving a good consistent look to the entire device. 
Speaking about rugged cases, here are some of the best cases you can get for the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro.

 
## 11. Galaxy Watch Rugged Cover


Samsung itself made a rugged cover for the Watch 5 Pro. Unlike the bands, the cover is made especially for the Watch 5 Pro and will not fit any other models. Compared to cases from other brands, Samsung takes a minimal approach and its cover adds some extra protection to the watch. It costs $19.99, but if you are looking for a rugged case completely for protection, continue reading.

## 12. Caseology Vault
 
## 13. Supcase Unicorn Beetle Pro


Though the name may sound weird, the Beetle Pro case comes with bands giving your Watch 5 Pro a uniform look. If you want to change your smartwatch’s look to a G-Shock, then this is for you. Both the case and bands are premium and made especially for protection. The price of the Beetle Pro is $21.99 which is worth the quality of the product.

 
## 14. Nxtudy Protective Cover with Tampered Glass


If you just want a cover that adds additional protection instead of going for the whole cowboy rugged feel, then Nxtudy is a good choice to start with. The product is minimal just like the official one from Samsung. While Samsung’s cover is only made to cover the top part of the watch, Nxtudy covers the entire watch. Also, the cover is just $7.99 making it much better than the official cover from Samsung. It also comes with a tampered glass which works great with the Watch 5 Pro and also the cover from Nxtudy. 
But if you are looking for just tampered glass, you can also get them separately. 

 
## 15. Spigen Tampered Glass


Spigen Tempered Glass is high quality and you get 2 tampered glasses in a single pack. The best part is that it also comes with the required tool to install the tampered glass yourself. You can easily align the tampered glass on the watch using the tool. It costs $15.99 and is completely worth the price because of the tool that helps you align and install the tampered glass by yourself. 

 
## 16. The Samsung Nest Tampered Glass


Watches take a lot of damage than phones. So if you prefer to get more tampered glasses for less price in bulk for your Watch 5 Pro, choose Samsung Nest tampered glass. It costs $29.99, but for the price, you get 4 tampered glasses and some additional accessories such as a wet wipe, cleaning cloth, and dust absorbing sticker. It does not come with a tool, so you have to align the screen protector yourself.

Finally, here are some good chargers you should consider.

 
## 17. Galaxy Watch Charging Cradle


Galaxy Watch comes with a charging cable in the box. In case, you need another, you can buy it from Samsung Store. It is a wired charger for your watch. If you prefer to go on the wireless charging route, then you should definitely consider Samsung’s official charging cradle. Most other wireless chargers do not work with the new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro series because of Samsung’s design choices. You cannot place your watch on a flat surface anymore. So Samsung recently released this charging cradle which keeps going out of stock. It works with Watch 4, Watch 5, and Watch 5 Pro.

## 18. Galaxy Watch Wireless Charging Dock 


Apart from the new cradle design, you can also try their wireless charging dock. It is cheaper and also smaller than the cradle. It works fine with the Galaxy Watch 5 and Watch 5 Pro, but you need to align it perfectly as the charging surface on Watch 5 Pro is smaller than the Watch 4.

## 19. Sowink Dual Wireless Charger For Watch and Phone


Anyhow it comes with two major disadvantages. Though the company claims the output is 18 Watts, many people have mentioned it is charging the watch slower than the official charger. Also because of the Watch 5 Pro design, you need to remove the straps to charge with this charger. 

 
## 20. Oriflame Dual Wired Charger for Watch and Phone


While the dual wireless charger is good, the only issue is that it’s hard to charge Galaxy Watch 5 Pro by removing the straps every time. You can solve that issue with a wired charger. Now it becomes easy to charge the watch, however, it’s not wireless so you need to deal with the cable. It costs $14.99 and is overall a good buy if you are fine with the cable part. Just like the Sowink charger, it is slow.

 
## There’s More


These are just some accessories for Galaxy Watch 5 Pro that I think are amazing and worth getting to protect and improve your experience. There are other notable Galaxy products such as Galaxy Buds 2 Pro that can connect to your Galaxy Watch like no other earphones. Also, you can get a Samsung Galaxy Phone to enjoy the rich Samsung ecosystem between both devices via apps like Calendar, Samsung Health, Weather, Phone, Contacts, etc.
